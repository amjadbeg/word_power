HOW TO USE THIS BOOK 
FOR MAXIMUM BENEFIT 


1. this is not a reading book . . . 

Don't read this hook! 

Instead, work with it. Write in it, talk aloud to it, talk back to 
it—use your pen or pencil, your voice, not just your eyes and 
mind. 

Learning, real learning , goes on only through active partici¬ 
pation . 

When a new word occurs in a chapter, say it aloud! (The pho¬ 
netic respellirig will help you pronounce it correctly.) * 

When you do the matching exercises, use a pen or pencil. Write 
your responses! (Check the key that immediately follows each ex¬ 
ercise after you have filled in all the answers.) 

When you do the “Yes-No,” “True-False,” or “Same-Opposite” 
exercises, use your pen or pencil to indicate the appropriate re¬ 
sponse, then check with the key when you have completed the 
whole exercise. 

When you are asked to fill in words that fit definitions, write 
your answers; then check the key both to see if you have re- 

* The system of pronunciation symbols will be thoroughly explained in 
Section 2 of this chapter. 


xv 



sponded with the right word and also to make sure your spelling is 
correct. 

When you do the Review of Etymology exercises, make sure to 
fill in the English word containing the prefix, root, or suffix 
required—use a chapter word, or any other word that comes to 
mind. (Coin words if you like!) 

Pay special attention to the Chapter Reviews . Are the words 
still fresh in your mind? Do you remember the meaning of each 
root studied in the previous sessions? In these Reviews , you are 
not only testing your learning but also tightening up any areas in 
which you discover lacks, weaknesses, or lapses of memory. 


2. master the pronunciation system! 


Saying words aloud, and saying them right, is half the battle in 
feeling comfortable and assured with all the new words you are 
going to learn. Every word taught is respelled to show its pronun¬ 
ciation, so pay close attention to how the phonetic symbols work. 


(a) First, master the “schwa”! 

Almost every English word of two or more syllables contains 
one or several syllables in which the vowel sound is said very 
quickly. For example: 

“Linda spoke to her mother about a different idea she had.” 
->Read the previous sentence aloud at normal conversational 
speed. 

Read it again. Listen to how the -a of Linda; the -er of mother; 
the a- of about; the -er and -ent of different; and the -a of idea 
sound. 

Very quick—very short! Right? 

Phonetically respelled, these words are represented as: 


1. Linda 

2. mother 

3. about 

4. different 

5. idea 


LIN'-da 

MUTR'-ar 

a-BOWT' 

DIF'-ar-ant 

I-DEE'-a 


The symbol “a,” called a schwa, represents the quick, short 
vowel sound in the five words above. 


xvi 



Now look back at the sentence preceded by an arrow. 

The italicized words are rewritten as: 

1. previous PREE'-vee-as 

2. sentence SEN'-tens 

3. aloud s-LOWD' 

4. normal NAWR'-mol 

5. conversational kon'-var-SAY'-shon-ol 

You will find a in almost all words that are phonetically 
respelled throughout this book. Say the five italicized words aloud 
and make sure you understand how the schwa (a) sounds. 

(b) Next, understand accent. 

Look at word (5) above: conversational: kon'-var-SAY'-shan-al. 
Note that there are two accent marks, one on kon', another on 
SAY'. Note also that kon' is in lower-case letters, SAY' in capitals. 
Both syllables are stressed, but the one in capitals (SAY') sounds 
stronger (or louder) than the one in lower case (kon'). Say con¬ 
versational aloud, noting the difference. 

Say these three words, taken from Chapter 3, aloud, noticing 
the variation in stress between the lower-case and the capitalized 
syllables: 

1. egomaniacal ee'-go-ma-NT'-s-kd 

2. altercation awl'-tsr-KAY'-shan 

3. anthropological an'-thrs-ps-LOJ'-o-kol 

(c) Be careful of the letter "S” (or “s”) in phonetic respellings. 

S (or s) is always hissed, as in see, some, such. After an -n, you 

will be tempted to buzz (or “voice”) the - s, because final -ns is 
usually pronounced -nz, as in wins, tons, owns, etc. (Say these 
three words aloud—hear the z at the end?) Resist the temptation! 
S (or s) is always hissed in phonetic respellings! 

Say these words aloud: 

1. ambivalence t am-BIV'-s-bns 

2. affluence AF'-l<5b-ons 

3. opulence OP'-yo-bns 

4. sentence SEN'-tans 

t All unusual words in this chapter are taught in later chapters of the book. 

xvii 



(d) The symbol i or l is pronounced eye, to rhyme with high, 
sigh, my, etc., no matter where you find it. For example: 

1. fights 

FITS 

2. spy 

SPI 

3. malign 

ma-LIN' 

4. civilize 

SIV'-a-IIz' 

[/ or i (without the top bar) is pronounced as in it, sit, pitch.] 

(e) All consonants have their normal sounds . 

Except for G (or g), which is always pronounced as in give. 

girl, get, go. 


1. agree 

o-GREE' 

2. pagan 

PAY'-gan 

3. again 

o-GEN' 

(f) The vowel sounds are as follows:

1. A, a 

cat (KAT) 

2. E,e

sit (SIT)

3. a word (or words) on western and eastern pronunciation 

In the New York City area, and in parts of New Jersey and 
other eastern states, the syllables - ar, -er, -or, -off, and -aw are 
pronounced somewhat differently from the way they are said in 
the Midwest and in the West. 

In New York City, for example, the words below are generally 


pronounced as follows: 


orange 

AHR'-snj 

talk 

TAWK 

coffee 

KAW'-fee 

sorority 

so-RAHR'-a-tee 

incorrigible 

in-KAHR'-a-ja-bal 

disparage 

dis-PAR'-sj (A as in HAT) 

merry 

MER'-ee (E as in WET) 

marry 

MAR'-ee (A as in HAT) 

astronaut 

AS'-tra-nawt' 

Harry 

HAR'-ee (A as in HAT) 

In the Midwest and West, on the other hand, the same words 
are usually said approximately as follows: 

orange 

AWR'-gnj 

talk 

TOK 

coffee 

KOF-ee 

sorority 

sa-RAWR'-a-tee 

incorrigible 

in-KAWR'-s-js-bal 

disparage 

dis-PAIR'-aj 

merry 

MAIR'-ee 

marry 

MAIR'-ee 

astronaut 

AS'-tro-not' 

Harry 

HAIR'-ee 

Nothing so radical here that a person brought up in Brooklyn 
or the Bronx cannot understand a native of Los Angeles or San 
Francisco—it’s just that each one thinks the other has an ac- 


cent! 

In California, for example, Mary , merry, and marry sound al- 

xix 



most exactly alike—In New York, they are usually heard as quite 
different words. 

(So, to be sexist for a moment, if the men at a party in Manhat¬ 
tan say, “Let’s all make merry!”, Mary doesn’t feel that she is 
about to seduced by the males!) 

In the phonetic respellings throughout the book, the western 
pronunciations of words with the syllables remarked on above are 
used. This is done largely because I myself have lived in the Los 
Angeles area for some fourteen years, and have had to retrain my 
pronunciation (having come from New York City, where I was 
born, and lived all my life until 1964) so that my friends and stu¬ 
dents would stop making fun of the way I speak. 

Neither form of pronunciation is any better nor any more 
euphonious than the other . Throughout the country, pronun¬ 
ciation varies not only from region to region or state to state, but 
often from city to city! The changes are slight and subtle, but they 
do exist, and an expert can easily pinpoint the geographical source 
of a person’s language patterns almost down to a few square miles 
in area. 

If you are an Easterner, you will have no difficulty translating 
the pronunciations of words like sorority, incorrigible, disparage, 
and astronaut (all words discussed in later chapters) into your 
own comfortable language patterns. 

4. why etymology? 

Etymology (et'-a-MOL'-s-jee) deals with the origin or deriva¬ 
tion of words. 

When you know the meaning of a root (for example, Latin ego, 
I or self), you can better understand, and more easily remember, 
all the words built on this root. 

Learn one root and you have the key that will unlock the mean¬ 
ings of up to ten or twenty words in which the root appears . 

Learn ego and you can immediately get a handle on egocentric, 
egomaniac, egoist, egotist, and alter ego. 

Learn anthropos (Greek, mankind), and you will, quickly un¬ 
derstand, and never forget, anthropology, misanthropy, anthropoid. 


xx 



anthropocentric, anthropomorphic , philanthropy , and anthropo- 
phohia . Meet any word with anthropo- in it, and you will have at 
least some idea of its meaning. 

In the etymological (et'a-ms-LOJ'-s-kal) approach to vocabu¬ 
lary building: 

• You will learn about prefixes, roots, and suffixes — 

• You will be able to figure out unfamiliar words by recognizing 
their structure, the building blocks from which they are con¬ 
structed— 

• You will be able to construct words correctly by learning to 
put these building blocks together in the proper way—and 

• You will be able to derive verbs from nouns, nouns and 
verbs from adjectives, adjectives from nouns, etc.—and do all 
this correctly. 

Learn how to deal with etymology and you will feel comfortable 
with words—you will use new words with self-assurance—you 
will be able to figure out thousands of words you hear or read 
even if you have never heard or seen these words before. 

That’s why the best approach to new words is through etymol- 
ogy$—as you will discover for yourself as soon as you start to 
work on chapter 3! 


5 . but what are nouns, verbs, and adjectives? 

You probably know. 

But if you don’t, you can master these parts of speech (and ref¬ 
erence will be made to noun forms, verb forms , and adjective 
forms throughout the book) within the next five minutes. 

(a) A noun is a word that can be preceded by a, an, the, some, 
such, or my. 

An egoist (noun) 

t Incidentally, Latin scholars will notice that I present a Latin verb in the 
first person singular, present tense ( verto, I turn), but call it an infinitive 
( verto , to turn). I do this for two reasons: 1) verto is easier for a non- 
Latin scholar to pronounce (the actual infinitive, veriere, is pronounced 
WAIR'-ta-ray); and 2) when I studied Latin fifty years ago, the convention 
was to refer to a verb by using the first person singular, present tense. 

If you are not a Latin scholar, you need not bother to read this foot¬ 
note—if you’ve already done so, forget it! 


xxi 



Such asceticism (noun) 

The misogynist (noun) 

(Nouns, you will discover, often end in conventional suffixes: 
-ness,-ity, -ism, -y, -ion, etc.) 

(b) A verb is a word that fits into the pattern, “Let us 

___.” A verb has a past tense. 

Let us equivocate (verb)—past tense: equivocated . 

Let us alternate (verb)—past tense: alternated . 

Let us philander (verb)—past tense: philandered . 

(Verbs, you will discover, often end in conventional suffixes: 
-ate, -ize, -fy, etc.) 

(c) An adjective is a word that fits into the pattern, “You are 

very_” 

You are very egoistic (adjective). 

You are very introverted (adjective). 

You are very misogynous (adjective). 

(Adjectives, you will discover, often end in conventional 
suffixes: -ic, -ed, -ous, -al, -ive, etc.) 

And adverbs, of course, are generally formed by adding - ly to 
an adjective: misogynous-misogynously; educational-education- 
ally; etc. 

That’s all there is to it! (Did it take more than five minutes? 
Maybe ten at the most?) 


6. how to work for best results 

If you intend to work with this book seriously (that is, if your 
clear intention is to add a thousand or more new words to your 
present vocabulary—add them permanently, unforgettably—add 
them so successfully that you will soon find yourself using them in 
speech and writing), I suggest that you give yourself every advan¬ 
tage by carefully following the laws of learning: 

(a) Space your learning . 

Beginning with Chapter 3, every chapter will be divided into 
“sessions.” Each session may take one half hour to an hour and a 
half, depending on the amount of material and on your own speed 
of learning. 


xxii 



Do one or two sessions at a time—three if you’re going strong 
and are all involved—and always decide when you stop exactly 
when you will return. (I remind you to do this later in the book, 
since such a procedure is of crucial importance.) 

(b) Do not rush—go at your own comfortable speed. 

Everyone learns at a different pace. Fast learners are no better 

than slow learners—it’s the end result that counts, not the time it 
takes you to finish. 

(c) Review. 

When you start a new session, go back to the last exercise of the 
previous session (usually Can you recall the words? or Chapter 
Review ), cover your answers, and test your retention—do you 
have quick recall after a day or so has elapsed? 

(d) Test yourself. 

You are not aiming for a grade, or putting your worth on the 
line, when you take the three Comprehensive Tests (Chapters 8, 
13, and 17)—rather you are discovering your weaknesses, if any; 
deciding where repairs have to be made; and, especially, ex¬ 
periencing a feeling of success at work well done. (In learning, 
too, nothing succeeds like success!) 

Use these three tests, as well as the abundant drill exercises, as 
aids to learning. No one is perfect, no one learns in the exact same 
way or at the same rate as anyone else. Find the optimum tech¬ 
nique and speed for your unique learning patterns—and then give 
yourself every opportunity to exploit your actual, latent, and po¬ 
tential abilities. 

But most important (as I will remind you several times 
throughout the book)—develop a routine and stick to it!

Disclaimer: 


Occasionally in these pages, owing to the deficiency of the Eng¬ 
lish language, I have used he/him/his meaning he or she/him or 
her/his or her in order to avoid awkwardness of style. 

He, him, and his are not intended as exclusively masculine 
pronouns—they may refer to either sex or to both sexes.

HOW TO TEST YOUR 
PRESENT VOCABULARY 


Once—as a child—you were an expert, an accomplished virtuoso , 
at learning new words . 

Today , by comparison , you are a rank and bumbling amateur . 

Does this statement sound insulting? 

It may be—but if you are the average adult, it is a statement 
that is, unfortunately, only too true. 

Educational testing indicates that children of ten who have 
grown up in families in which English is the native language have 
recognition vocabularies of over twenty thousand words— 

And that these same ten-year-olds have been learning new 
words at a rate of many hundreds a year since the age of four . 

In astonishing contrast, studies show that adults who are no 
longer attending school increase their vocabularies at a pace 
slower than twenty-five to fifty words annually . 

How do you assess your own vocabulary? 

Is it quantitatively healthy? 

Rich in over-all range? 

Responsive to any situation in which you may find yourself? 

Truly indicative of your intellectual potential? 

More important, is it still growing at the same rapid clip as 
when you were a child? 

Or, as with most adults, has your rate of increase dropped dras- 


3 



tically since you left school? And if so, do you now feel that your 
vocabulary is somewhat limited, your verbal skills not as sharp as 
you would like them to be? 

Let us check it out.

ulary range, as well as your verbal speed and responsiveness.

VOCABULARY AND SUCCESS 

Now you know where you stand. If you are in the below aver¬ 
age or average group, you must consider, seriously, whether an in¬ 
adequate vocabulary may be holding you back. (If you tested out 
on the above average, excellent, or superior level, you have doubt¬ 
less already discovered the unique and far-reaching value of a rich 
vocabulary, and you are eager to add still further to your knowl¬ 
edge of words.) 

Let us examine, briefly, some of the evidence that points to the 
close relationship between vocabulary and personal, professional, 
and intellectual growth. 

The Human Engineering Laboratory found that the only com¬ 
mon characteristic of successful people in this country is an unu¬ 
sual grasp of the meanings of words. The Laboratory tested the 
vocabularies of thousands of people in all age groups and in all 
walks of life—and discovered that those people drawing down the 
highest salaries made the highest scores. Consider very thought¬ 
fully the explanation that the director of the Laboratory offered 
for the relationship between vocabulary and success: 

“Why do large vocabularies characterize executives and possi¬ 
bly outstanding men and women in other fields? The final answer 
seems to be that words are the instruments by means of which 
men and women grasp the thoughts of others and with which they 
do much of their own thinking. They are the tools of thought.” 

There is other evidence. 

At many universities, groups of freshmen were put into experi¬ 
mental classes for the sole purpose of increasing their knowledge 
of English words. These groups did better in their sophomore , 
junior , and senior years than control groups of similarly endowed 
students who did not receive such training. 


17 




And still more evidence: 

At the University of Illinois, entering students were given a sim¬ 
ple twenty-nine-word vocabulary test. The results of this test 
could be used, according to Professor William D. Templeman, to 
make an accurate prediction of future academic success—or lack 
of success—over the entire four year college course. “If a student 
has a superior vocabulary,” states Professor Templeman, “it will 
probably follow that he will do better work academically.” 

And finally: 

Educational research has discovered that your I.Q. is intimately 
related to your vocabulary. Take a standard vocabulary test and 
then an intelligence test—the results in both will be substantially 
the same. 


YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR VOCABULARY 

The more extensive your vocabulary, the better your chances 
for success, other things being equal—success in attaining your 
educational goals, success in moving ahead in your business or pro¬ 
fessional career, success in achieving your intellectual potential. 

And you can increase your vocabulary—faster and easier than 
you may realize. 

You can, in fact, accomplish a tremendous gain in less than two 
to three months of concentrated effort, even if you do only one 
session a day—in less time if you do two or more sessions a day. 

Furthermore— 

You can start improving your vocabulary immediately—and 
within a few days you can be cruising along at such a rapid rate 
that there will be an actual change in your thinking , in your ability 
to express your thoughts , and in your powers of understanding. 

Does this sound as if I am promising you the whole world in a 
neat package with a pretty pink ribbon tied around it? I am. And 
I am willing to make such an unqualified promise because I have 
seen what happens to those of my students at New York Univer¬ 
sity and at Rio Hondo College in Whittier, California, who make 
sincere, methodical efforts to learn more, many more, words.

HOW TO START BUILDING 
YOUR VOCABULARY 


When you have finished working with this book, you will no 
longer be the same person. 

You can’t be. 

If you honestly read every page, if you do every exercise, if you 
take every test, if you follow every principle, you will go through 
an intellectual experience that will effect a radical change in you. 

For if you systematically increase your vocabulary, you will also 
sharpen and enrich your thinking; push back your intellectual ho¬ 
rizons; build your self-assurance; improve your facility in handling 
the English language and thereby your ability to express your 
thoughts effectively; and acquire a deeper understanding of the 
world in general and of yourself in particular. 

Increasing your vocabulary does not mean merely learning the 
definitions of large numbers of obscure words; it does not mean 
memorizing scores of unrelated terms. What it means—what it 
can only mean—is becoming acquainted with the multitudinous 
and fascinating phenomena of human existence for which words 
are, obviously, only the verbal descriptions. 

Increasing your vocabulary—properly, intelligently, and sys¬ 
tematically—means treating yourself to an all-round, liberal edu¬ 
cation. 


19 



And surely you cannot deny that such an experience will change 
you intellectually— 

Will have a discernible effect on your methods of thinking—on 
your store of information—on your ability to express your ideas 
—on your understanding of human problems. 


HOW CHILDREN INCREASE THEIR VOCABULARIES 

The typical ten-year-old, you will recall, has a recognition vo¬ 
cabulary of over twenty thousand words—and has been learning 
many hundreds of new words every year since the age of four. 

You were once that typical child. 

You were once an accomplished virtuoso at vocabulary build¬ 
ing. 

What was your secret? 

Did you spend hours every day poring over a dictionary? 

Did you lull yourself to sleep at night with Webster’s Un¬ 
abridged? 

Did you keep notebooks full of all the new words you ever 
heard or read? 

Did you immediately look up the meaning of any new word that 
your parents or older members of your family used? 

Such procedures would have struck you as absurd then, as ab¬ 
surd as they would be for you today. 

You had a much better, much more effective, and considerably 
less self-conscious method. 

Your method was the essence of simplicity: day in and day out 
you kept learning; you kept squeezing every possible ounce of 
learning out of every waking moment; you were an eternal ques¬ 
tion box, for you had a constant and insatiable desire to know and 
understand. 


20 



HOW ADULTS STOP BUILDING THEIR VOCABULARIES 

Then, eventually, at some point in your adult life (unless you 
are the rare exception), you gradually lost your compulsive drive 
to discover, to figure out, to understand, to know. 

Eventually, therefore, you gradually lost your need to increase 
your vocabulary—your need to learn the words that could verbal¬ 
ize your new discoveries, your new understanding, your new 
knowledge. 

Roland Gelatt, in a review of Caroline Pratt’s book I Learn 
from Children , describes this phenomenon as follows: 

All normal human beings are born with a powerful urge to 
learn. Almost all of them lose this urge, even before they 
have reached maturity. It is only the few . . . who are so 
constituted that lack of learning becomes a nuisance. This is 
perhaps the most insidious of human tragedies. 

Children are wonders at increasing their vocabularies because 
of their “powerful urge to learn.” They do not learn solely by 
means of words, but as their knowledge increases, so does their 
vocabulary—for words are the symbols of ideas and under¬ 
standing. 

(If you are a parent, you perhaps remember that crucial and 
trying period in which your child constantly asked “Why?” The 
“Why?” is the child’s method of finding out. How many adults 
that you know go about asking and thinking “Why?” How often 
do you yourself do it?) 

The adults who “lose this urge,” who no longer feel that “lack 
of learning becomes a nuisance,” stop building their vocabularies. 
They stop learning, they stop growing intellectually, they stop 
changing. When and if such a time comes, then, as Mr. Gelatt so 
truly says, “This is perhaps the most insidious of human trage¬ 
dies.” But fortunately the process is far from irreversible. 


21 



If you have lost the “powerful urge to learn,” you can regain 
it—you can regain your need to discover, to figure out, to under¬ 
stand, to know. 

And thus you can start increasing your vocabulary at the same 
rate as when you were a child. 

I am not spouting airy theory. For over thirty-five years I have 
worked with thousands of adults in my college courses in vocabu¬ 
lary improvement, and I can state as a fact, and without qualifica¬ 
tion, that: 

If you can recapture the “powerful urge to learn” with which 
you were born , you can go on increasing your vocabulary at a pro - 
digious rate — 

No matter what your present age . 


WHY AGE MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN VOCABULARY BUILDING 

I repeat, no matter what your present age. 

You may be laboring under a delusion common to many older 
people. 

You may think that after you pass your twenties you rapidly 
and inevitably lose your ability to learn. 

That is simply not true. 

There is no doubt that the years up to eighteen or twenty are 
the best period for learning. Your own experience no doubt bears 
that out. And of course for most people more learning goes on 
faster up to the age of eighteen or twenty than ever after, even if 
they live to be older than Methuselah. (That is why vocabulary 
increases so rapidly for the first twenty years of life* and compara¬ 
tively at a snail’s pace thereafter.) 

But (and follow me closely)— 

The fact that most learning is accomplished before the age of 
twenty does not mean that very little learning can be achieved be¬ 
yond that age. 

What is done by most people and what can be done under 
proper guidance and motivation are two very, very different things 
—as scientific experiments have conclusively shown. 


22 



Furthermore— 

The fact that your learning ability may be best up to age twenty 
does not mean that it is absolutely useless as soon as your twenti¬ 
eth birthday is passed. 

Quite the contrary. 

Edward Thorndike, the famous educational psychologist, found 
in experiments with people of all ages that although the learning 
curve rises spectacularly up to twenty, it remains steady for at 
least another five years. After that, ability to learn (according to 
Professor Thorndike) drops very, very slowly up to the age of 
thirty-five, and drops a bit more but still slowly beyond that age. 

And— 

Right up to senility the total decrease in learning ability after 
age twenty is never more than 15 per cent! 

That does not sound, I submit, as if no one can ever learn any¬ 
thing new after the age of twenty. 

Believe me, the old saw that claims you cannot teach an old dog 
new tricks is a baseless, if popular, superstition. 

So I repeat: no matter what your age, you can go on learning 
efficiently, or start learning once again if perhaps you have 
stopped. 

You can be thirty, or forty, or fifty, or sixty, or seventy—or 
older. 

No matter what your age, you can once again increase your vo¬ 
cabulary at a prodigious rate—providing you recapture the “pow¬ 
erful urge to learn” that is the key to vocabulary improvement. 

Not the urge to learn “words”—words are only symbols of 
ideas. 

But the urge to learn facts, theories, concepts, information, 
knowledge, understanding—call it what you will. 

Words are the symbols of knowledge, the keys to accurate 
thinking. Is it any wonder then that the most successful and intel¬ 
ligent people in this country have the biggest vocabularies? 

It was not their large vocabularies that made these people suc¬ 
cessful and intelligent, but their knowledge. 

Knowledge, however, is gained largely through words. 

In the process of increasing their knowledge, these successful 
people increased their vocabularies. 

Just as children increase their vocabulary at a tremendous, phe- 

23 



nomenal rate during those years when their knowledge is increas¬ 
ing most rapidly. 

Knowledge is chiefly in the form of words, and from now on, in 
this book, you will be thinking about , and thinking with , new 
words and new ideas. 


WHAT THIS BOOK CAN DO FOR YOU 

This book is designed to get you started building your vocabu¬ 
lary—effectively and at jet-propelled speed—by helping you re¬ 
gain the intellectual atmosphere, the keen, insatiable curiosity, the 
“powerful urge to learn” of your childhood. 

The organization of the book is based on two simple principles: 
1) words are the verbal symbols of ideas, and 2) the more ideas 
you are familiar with, the more words you know. 

So, chapter by chapter, we will start with some central idea— 
personality types, doctors, science, unusual occupations, liars, ac¬ 
tions, speech habits, insults, compliments, etc.—and examine ten 
basic words that express various aspects of the idea. Then, using 
each word as a springboard, we will explore any others which are 
related to it in meaning or derivation, so that it is not unlikely that 
a single chapter may discuss, teach, and test close to one hundred 
important words. 

Always, however, the approach will be from the idea. First 
there will be a “teaser preview” in which the ideas are briefly 
hinted at; then a “headline,” in which each idea is examined 
somewhat more closely; next a clear, detailed paragraph or more 
will analyze the idea in all its ramifications; finally the word itself, 
which you will meet only after you are completely familiar with 
the idea. 

In the etymology (derivation of words) section, you will learn 
what Greek or Latin root gives the word its unique meaning and 
what other words contain the same, or related, roots. You will thus 
be continually working in related fields, and there will never be 
any possibility of confusion from “too muchness,” despite the 
great number of words taken up and tested in each chapter. 

Successful people have superior vocabularies. People who are 


24 



intellectually alive and successful in the professional or business 
worlds are accustomed to dealing with ideas, are constantly on the 
search for new ideas, build their lives and their careers on the 
ideas they have learned. And it is to readers whose goal is success¬ 
ful living (in the broadest meaning of the word successful) that 
this book is addressed. 


A NOTE ON TIME SCHEDULES 

From my experience over many years in teaching, I have be¬ 
come a firm believer in setting a goal for all learning and a sched¬ 
ule for reaching that goal. 

You will discover that each chapter is divided into approxi¬ 
mately equal sessions, and that each session will take from thirty 
to forty-five minutes of your time, depending on how rapidly or 
slowly you enjoy working—and bear in mind that everyone has an 
optimum rate of learning. 

For best results, do one or two sessions at a time—spaced study¬ 
ing, with time between sessions so that you can assimilate what 
you have learned, is far more efficient, far more productive, than 
gobbling up great amounts in indigestible chunks. 

Come back to the book every day, or as close to every day as 
the circumstances of your life permit. 

Find a schedule that is comfortable for you , and then stick to it. 

Avoid interrupting your work until you have completed a full 
session, and always decide, before you stop, exactly when you will 
plan to pick up the book again. 

Working at your own comfortable rate, you will likely finish the 
material in two to three months, give or take a few weeks either 
way. 

However long you take, you will end with a solid feeling of ac¬ 
complishment, a new understanding of how English words work , 
and—most important—how to make words work for you.

HOW TO TALK ABOUT 
PERSONALITY TYPES 

(Sessions 1-3) 


TEASER PREVIEW 

What word best describes your personality if you: 

• are interested solely in your own welfare? 

• constantly talk about yourself? 

• dedicate your life to helping others? 

• turn your mind inward? 

• turn your mind outward? 

• hate humanity? 

• hate women? 

• hate marriage? 

• lead a lonely , austere existence? 


26 



SESSION 1 


Every human being is, in one way or another, unique. 

Everyone’s personality is determined by a combination of ge¬ 
netic and environmental factors. 

Let us examine ten personality types (one of which might by 
chance be your very own) that result from the way culture, 
growth, family background, and environment interact with hered¬ 
ity. 

And, of course, we begin not with the words, but with the ideas. 


IDEAS 


1. me first 

Your attitude to life is simple, direct, and aboveboard—every 
decision you make is based on the answer to one question: 
“What’s in it for me?” If your selfishness, greed, and ruthless 
desire for self-advancement hurt other people, that’s too bad. 
“This is a tough world, pal, dog eat dog and all that, and I, for 
one, am not going to be left behind!” 

An egoist 


2. the height of conceit 

“Now, let’s see. Have you heard about all the money I’m mak¬ 
ing? Did I tell you about my latest amorous conquest? Let me give 
you my opinion—I know, because I’m an expert at practically ev¬ 
erything!” You are boastful to the point of being obnoxious—you 
have only one string to your conversational violin, namely, your - 


27 



self; and on it you play a number of monotonous variations: what 
you think, what you have done, how good you are, how you 
would solve the problems of the world, etc. ad nauseam. 

An egotist 


3. let me help you 

You have discovered the secret of true happiness—concerning 
yourself with the welfare of others. Never mind your'own inter¬ 
ests, how’s the next fellow getting along? 

An altruist 


4. leave me alone 

Like a biochemist studying a colony of bacteria under the mi¬ 
croscope, you minutely examine your every thought, feeling, and 
action. Probing, futile questions like “What do other people think 
of me?”, “How do I look?”, and “Maybe I shouldn’t have said 
that?” are your constant nagging companions, for you are unable 
to realize that other people do not spend as much time and energy 
analyzing you as you think. 

You may seem unsocial, yet your greatest desire is to be liked 
and accepted. You may be shy and quiet, you are often moody 
and unhappy, and you prefer solitude or at most the company of 
one person to a crowd. You have an aptitude for creative work 
and are uncomfortable engaging in activities that require co¬ 
operation with other people. You may even be a genius, or eventu¬ 
ally turn into one. 

An introvert 


5. let’s do it together 

You would be great as a teacher, counselor, administrator, in¬ 
surance agent. You can always become interested—sincerely, vi¬ 
tally interested—in other people’s problems. You’re the life of the 
party, because you never worry about the effect of your actions, 
never inhibit yourself with doubts about dignity or propriety. You 


28 



are usually happy, generally full of high spirits; you love to be 
with people—lots of people. Your thoughts, your interests, your 
whole personality are turned outward. 

An extrovert 


6. neither extreme 

You have both introverted and extroverted tendencies—at 
different times and on different occasions. Your interests are 
turned, in about equal proportions, both inward and outward. In¬ 
deed, you’re quite normal—in the sense that your personality is 
like that of most people. 

An ambivert 


7. people are no damn good 

Cynical, embittered, suspicious, you hate everyone. (Especially, 
but never to be admitted, yourself?) The perfectibility of the 
human race? “Nonsense! No way!” The stupidity, the meanness, 
and the crookedness of most mortals (“Most? Probably all!”)— 
that is your favorite theme. 

A misanthrope 


8. women are no damn good 

Sometime in your dim past, you were crossed, scorned, or deeply 
wounded by a woman (a mother, or mother figure, perhaps?). So 
now you have a carefully constructed defense against further hurt 
—you hate all women. 

A misogynist 


9. “marriage is an institution—and who wants to live in an institu¬ 
tion?” 

You will not make the ultimate legal commitment. Members of 
the opposite sex are great as lovers, roommates, apartment- or 
house-sharers, but not as lawfully wedded spouses. The ties that 


29 



bind are too binding for you. You may possibly believe, and pos¬ 
sibly, for yourself, be right, that a commitment is deeper and more 
meaningful if freedom is available without judicial proceedings. 

A misogamist 


10. . . that the flesh is heir to . . 

Self-denial, austerity, lonely contemplation—these are the char¬ 
acteristics of the good life, so you claim. The simplest food and 
the least amount of it that will keep body and soul together, com¬ 
bined with abstinence from fleshly, earthly pleasures, will eventu¬ 
ally lead to spiritual perfection—that is your philosophy. 

An ascetic 


USING THE WORDS 

You have been introduced to ten valuable words—but in each 
case, as you have noticed, you have first considered the ideas that 
these words represent. Now say the words—each one is respelled 
phonetically so that you will be sure to pronounce it correctly.* 

Say each word aloud. This is the first important step to com¬ 
plete mastery. As you hear a word in your own voice, think of its 
meaning. Are you quite clear about it? If not, reinforce your 
learning by rereading the explanatory paragraph or paragraphs.

{End of Session 1) 


SESSION 2 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

Every word in the English language has a history—and these 
ten are no exception. In this section you will learn a good deal 
more about the words you have been working with; in addition, 
you will make excursions into many other words allied either in 
meaning, form, or history to our basic ten. 

1. the ego 

Egoist and egotist are built on the same Latin root—the pro¬ 
noun ego , meaning 1.1 is the greatest concern in the egoist's mind, 
the most overused word in the egotist's vocabulary. (Keep the 


33 



words differentiated in your own mind by thinking of the t in 
talk, and the additional t in egotist .) Ego itself has been taken 
over from Latin as an important English word and is commonly 
used to denote one’s concept of oneself, as in, “What do you think 
your constant criticisms do to my ego?” Ego has also a special 
meaning in psychology—but for the moment you have enough 
problems without going into that. 

If you are an egocentric (ee'-go-SEN'-trik), you consider your¬ 
self the center of the universe—you are an extreme form of the 
egoist. And if you are an egomaniac (ee'-go-MAY'-nee-ak), you 
carry egoism to such an extreme that your needs, desires, and in¬ 
terests have become a morbid obsession, a mania. The egoist or 
egotist is obnoxious, the egocentric is intolerable, and the egoma¬ 
niac is dangerous and slightly mad. 

Egocentric is both a noun (“What an egocentric her new room¬ 
mate is!”) and an adjective (“He is the most egocentric person I 
have ever met!”). 

To derive the adjective form of egomaniac, add -al, a common 
adjective suffix. Say the adjective aloud: 

egomaniacal ee'-go-ms-N F-s-koI 


2. others 

In Latin, the word for other is alter, and a number of valuable 
English words are built on this root. 

Altruism (AL'-trOG-iz-am), the philosophy practiced by altru¬ 
ists, comes from one of the variant spellings of Latin alter, other. 
Altruistic (al-trGG-IS'-tik) actions look toward the benefit of 
others. If you alternate (AWL'-tar-nayt'), you skip one and take 
the other, so to speak, as when you play golf on alternate (AWL'- 
tor-not) Saturdays. 

An alternate (AWL'-tar-nat) in a debate, contest, or conven¬ 
tion is the other person who will take over if the original choice is 
unable to attend. And if you have no alternative (awl-TUR'-no- 
tiv), you have no other choice. 

You see how easy it is to understand the meanings of these 
words once you realize that they all come from the same source. 


34 



And keeping in mind that alter means other, you can quickly un¬ 
derstand words like alter ego, altercation, and alteration . 

An alteration (awl'-to-RAY'-shon) is of course a change—a 
making into something other. When you alter (AWL'-tar) your 
plans, you make other plans. 

An altercation (awl'-tor-KAY'-shan) is a verbal dispute. When 
you have an altercation with someone, you have a violent disagree¬ 
ment, a “fight” with words. And why? Because you have other 
ideas, plans, or opinions than those of the person on the other side 
of the argument. Altercation, by the way, is stronger than quarrel 
or dispute —the sentiment is more heated, the disagreement is 
likely to be angry or even hot-tempered, there may be recourse, if 
the disputants are human, to profanity or obscenity. You have 
altercations, in short, over pretty important issues, and the word 
implies that you get quite excited. 

Alter ego (AWL'-tar EE'-go), which combines alter, other, 
with ego, I, self, generally refers to someone with whom you are 
so close that you both do the same things, think alike, react 
similarly, and are, in temperament, almost mirror images of each 
other. Any such friend is your other I, your other self, your alter 
ego . 


USING THE WORDS 


Can you pronounce the words? 


Digging a little into the derivation of three of our basic words, 
egoist, egotist, and altruist, has put us in touch with two important 
Latin roots, ego, I, self, and alter, other, and has made it possible 
for us to explore, with little difficulty, many other words derived 
from these roots. Pause now, for a moment, to digest these new 
acquisitions, and to say them aloud.

SESSION 3 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. depends how you turn 

Introvert, extrovert, and ambivert are built on the Latin verb 
verto, to turn. If your thoughts are constantly turned inward 
(intro-), you are an introvert; outward ( extro -), an extrovert; 
and in both directions ( ambi -), an ambivert. The prefix ambi-, 
both, is also found in ambidextrous ( am'-bo-DEKS'-tras), able to 
use both hands with equal skill. The noun is ambidexterity (am'- 
bs-deks-TAIR'-s-tee ). 

Dexterous (DEKS'-ts-res) means skillful, the noun dexterity 
(deks-TAIR'-o-tee) is skill. The ending -ous is a common adjec¬ 
tive suffix (famous, dangerous, perilous, etc.); -ity is a common 
noun suffix (vanity, quality, simplicity, etc.). 

(Spelling caution: Note that the letter following the t- in am¬ 
bidextrous is -r, but that in dexterous the next letter is -e.) 

Dexter is actually the Latin word for right hand —in the am¬ 
bidextrous person, both hands are right hands, so to speak. 

The right hand is traditionally the more skillful one; it is only 
within recent decades that we have come to accept that “lefties” 
or “southpaws” are just as normal as anyone else—and the term 
left-handed is still used as a synonym of awkward. 

The Latin word for the left hand is sinister. This same word, in 
English, means threatening, evil, or dangerous, a further com¬ 
mentary on our early suspiciousness of left-handed persons. There 
may still be some parents who insist on forcing left-handed chil¬ 
dren to change (though left-handedness is inherited, and as much 
an integral part of its possessor as eye color or nose shape), with 
various unfortunate results to the child—sometimes stuttering or 
an inability to read with normal skill. 


39 



The French word for the left hand is gauche, and, as you would 
suspect, when we took this word over into English we invested it 
with an uncomplimentary meaning. Call someone gauche (GOSH) 
and you imply clumsiness, generally social rather than physical. 
(We’re right back to our age-old misconception that left-handed 
people are less skillful than right-handed ones.) A gauche remark 
is tactless; a gauche offer of sympathy is so bumbling as to be em¬ 
barrassing; gaucherie (GO'-sha-ree) is an awkward, clumsy, tact¬ 
less, embarrassing way of saying things or of handling situations. 
The gauche person is totally without finesse. 

And the French word for the right hand is droit, which we have 
used in building our English word adroit (a-DROYT'). Needless 
to say, adroit, like dexterous, means skillful, but especially in the 
exercise of the mental facilities. Like gauche, adroit or its noun 
adroitness, usually is used figuratively. The adroit person is quick¬ 
witted, can get out of difficult spots cleverly, can handle situations 
ingeniously. Adroitness is, then, quite the opposite of gaucherie. 


2. love, hate, and marriage 

Misanthrope , misogynist , and misogamist are built on the Greek 
root misein, to hate. The misanthrope hates mankind (Greek an* 
thropos, mankind); the misogynist hates women (Greek gyne, 
woman); the misogamist hates marriage (Greek gamos, mar¬ 
riage). 

Anthropos, mankind, is also found in anthropology (an-thra- 
POL'-a-jee), the study of the development of the human race; 
and in philanthropist (fa-LAN'-thra-pist), one who loves man¬ 
kind and shows such love by making substantial financial contri¬ 
butions to charitable organizations or by donating time and energy 
to helping those in need. 

The root gyne, v )man, is also found in gynecologist ( ;I? a- 
KDL'-o- ist or jin* -KOL'-a-jist), the medical specialis ho 
treats female disorders. And the root gamos, marriage, occurs also 
in monogamy (ma-NOG'-a-mee), bigamy (BIG'-a-mee), and 
polygamy (pa-LIG'-a-mee). 

(As we will discover later, monos means one, bi - means two, 
polys means many.) 


40 



bo monogamy is the custom of only one marriage (at a time). 

Bigamy , by etymology, is two marriages—in actuality, the un¬ 
lawful act of contracting another marriage without divorcing one’s 
current legal spouse. 

And polygamy , by derivation many marriages, and therefore ety¬ 
mologically denoting plural marriage for either males or females, 
in current usage generally refers to the custom practiced in earlier 
times by the Mormons, and before them by King Solomon, in 
which the man has as many wives as he can afford financially 
and/or emotionally. The correct, but rarely used, term for this 
custom is polygyny (po-LIJ'-a-nee)— polys, many, plus gyne, 
woman. 

What if a woman has two or more husbands, a form of mar¬ 
riage practiced in the Himalaya Mountains of Tibet? That custom 
is called polyandry (pol-ee-AN'-dree), from polys plus Greek 
andros, male. 


3. making friends with suffixes 


English words have various forms, using certain suffixes for 
nouns referring to persons, other suffixes for practices, attitudes, 
philosophies, etc, and still others for adjectives. 

Consider: 


Person 

Practice, etc. 

Adjective 

1. misanthrope or 

misanthropy 

misanthropic 

misanthropist 



2. misogynist 

misogyny 

misogynous or 



misogynistic 

3. gynecologist 

gynecology 

gynecological . 

4. monogamist 

monogamy 

monogamous 

5. bigamist 

bigamy 

bigamous 

6. polygamist 

polygamy 

polygamous 

7. polygynist 

polygyny 

polygynous 

8. polyandrist 

polyandry 

polyandrous 

9. philanthropist 

philanthropy 

philanthropic 

10. anthropologist 

anthropology 

anthropological 


You will note, then, that -ist is a common suffix for a person; -y 
for a practice, attitude, etc.; and -/c or - ous for an adjective. 


41 



4. living alone and liking it 

Ascetic is from the Greek word asketes, monk or hermit. 

A monk lives a lonely life—not for him the pleasures of the 
fleshpots, the laughter and merriment of convivial gatherings, the 
dissipation of high living. Rather, days of contemplation, study, 
and rough toil, nights on a hard bed in a simple cell, and the kind 
of self-denial that leads to a purification of the soul. 

That person is an ascetic who leads an existence, voluntarily of 
course, that compares in austerity, simplicity, and rigorous hard¬ 
ship with the life of a monk. 

The practice is asceticism (o-SET'-a-siz-om), the adjective as¬ 
cetic.

STICK TO YOUR TIME SCHEDULE! 


In three sessions, you have become acquainted with scores of 
new, vital, exciting words. You understand the ideas behind these 
words, their various forms and spellings, their pronunciation, their 
derivation, how they can be used, and exactly what they mean. I 
do not wish to press a point unduly, but it is possible that you 
have learned more new words in the short time it took you to 
cover this chapter than the average adult learns in an entire year. 
This realization should make you feel both gratified and excited. 

Funny thing about time. Aside from the fact that we all, rich or 
poor, sick or well, have the same amount of time, exactly twenty- 
four hours every day (that is looking at time from a static point of 
view), it is also true that we can always find time for the things we 
enjoy doing, almost never for the things we find unpleasant (and 
that is looking at time from the dynamic point of view). I am not 
merely being philosophical—I am sure you will agree with this 
concept if you give it a little thought. 

If you have enjoyed learning new words, accepting new chal¬ 
lenges, gaining new understanding^ and discovering the thrill of 
successful accomplishment, then make sure to stay with the time 
schedule you have set up for yourself. 

A crucial factor in successful , ongoing learning is routine. 

Develop a comfortable time routine, persevere against all dis¬ 
tractions, and you will learn anything you sincerely want to learn. 

So, to give yourself an edge, write here the day and hour you 
plan to return to your work:

■Brief Intermission One- 


TEST YOUR GRAMMAR 


How good is your English? Have you ever said me and then won¬ 
dered if it shouldn’t have been 1 —or vice versa? Do you some¬ 
times get a little confused about lay and lie or who and whom? 
Perhaps you are often a little less than certain about the distinc¬ 
tion between effect and affect , principal and principle , childish and 
childlike? 

Here is a series of quick tests that will show you how skillful 
you are in using the right word in the right place, that will give 
you a reliable indication of how your language ability compares 
with the average. 


TEST I—EASY 

If your English is every bit as good as average, you will have no 
difficulty making a proper choice in at least eight of the following 
ten sentences. 

1. There is a beautiful moon out tonight and Estelle and I are 
going for a stroll—would you like to come along with (she 
and I, her and me?) 

2. Your husband doesn’t believe that you are older than (I, 
me).

consider that your skill is distinctly above average—get all ten 
right to conclude that you rarely, if ever, make an error in gram¬ 
mar. 

1. What (effect, affect) has the new administration’s policies 
had on investor confidence? 

2. A feeling of one’s worth is one of the (principle, principal)

English. The next ten sentences are no cinch—you will be acquit¬ 
ting yourself creditably if you check the correct word five times

pert if you get nine or ten right.

SESSION 4 


In this chapter we discuss ten medical specialists—-what they 
do, how they do it, what they are called. 


IDEAS 


1. what’s wrong with you? 

To find out what ails you and why, this specialist gives you a 
thorough physical examination, using an impressive array of tests: 
X ray, blood chemistry, urinalysis, cardiogram, and so on. 

An internist 


2. female troubles? 

This specialist treats the female reproductive and sexual organs. 

A gynecologist 


3. having a baby? 

This specialist delivers babies and takes care of the mother dur¬ 
ing and immediately after the period of her pregnancy. 

An obstetrician 


4. is your baby ill? 

You know the common childhood maladies—mumps, whoop¬ 
ing cough, chicken pox, measles. This specialist limits his practice 
to youngsters, taking care of babies directly after birth, super¬ 
vising their diet and watching over their growth and development, 
giving them the series of inoculations that has done so much to 
decrease infant mortality, and soothing their anxious parents. 

A pediatrician 
55 



5. skin clear? 


You have heard the classic riddle: "What is the best use for 
pigskin?” Answer: “To keep the pig together.” Human skin has a 
similar purpose: it is, if we get down to fundamentals, what keeps 
us all in one piece. And our outer covering, like so many of our 
internal organs, is subject to diseases and infections of various 
kinds, running the gamut from simple acne and eczemas through 
impetigo, psoriasis, and cancer. There is a specialist who treats all 
such skin diseases. 


A dermatologist 


6. eyes okay? 

The physician whose specialty is disorders of vision (myopia, 
astigmatism, cataracts, glaucoma, etc.) may prescribe glasses, ad¬ 
minister drugs, or perform surgery. 

An ophthalmologist 


7. how are your bones? 

This specialist deals with the skeletal structure of the body, 
treating bone fractures, slipped discs, clubfoot, curvature of the 
spine, dislocations of the hip, etc., and may correct a condition ei¬ 
ther by surgery or by the use of braces or other appliances. 

An orthopedist 


8. does your heart go pitter-patter? 

This specialist treats diseases of the heart and circulatory sys¬ 
tem. 

A cardiologist 


9. is your brain working? 

This physician specializes in the treatment of disorders of the 
brain, spinal cord, and the rest of the nervous system. 

A neurologist 
56 



10. are you neurotic? 

This specialist attempts to alleviate mental and emotional dis¬ 
turbances by means of various techniques, occasionally drugs or 
electroshock, more often private or group psychotherapy. 

A psychiatrist

(End of session 4) 


SESSION 5 

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. inside you 

Internist and internal derive from the same Latin root, internus , 
inside. The internist is a specialist m internal medicine, in the ex- 


59 




ploration of your insides . This physician determines the state of 
your internal organs in order to discover what’s happening within 
your body ta cause the troubles you’re complaining of. 

Do not confuse the internist with the intern (also spelled in¬ 
terne), who is a medical graduate serving an apprenticeship inside 
a hospital. 


2. doctors for women 

The word gynecologist is built on Greek gyne, woman, plus 
logos, science; etymologically, gynecology is the science (in actual 
use, the medical science) of women. Adjective: gynecological (gm 
[or jin or jmJ-a-ko-LOJ'-o-kol). 

Obstetrician derives from Latin obstetrix, midwife, which in 
turn has its source in a Latin verb meaning to stand —midwives 
stand in front of the woman in labor to aid in the delivery of the 
infant. 

The suffix ician, as in obstetrician, physician, musician, magi¬ 
cian , electrician , etc., means expert 

Obstetrics (ob-STET'-riks) has only within the last 150 years 
become a respectable specialty. No further back than 1834, Pro¬ 
fessor William P. Dewees assumed the first chair of obstetrics at 
the University of Pennsylvania and had to brave considerable 
medical contempt and ridicule as a result—the delivery of chil¬ 
dren was then considered beneath the dignity of the medical pro¬ 
fession. 

Adjective: obstetric (ob-STET'-rik) or obstetrical (ob-STET'- 
rs-kol). 


3. children 

Pediatrician is a combination of Greek paidos, child; iatreia, 
medical healing; and -ician, expert 

Pediatrics (pee-dee-AT'-riks), then, is by etymology the medi¬ 
cal healing of a child. Adjective: pediatric (pee-dee-AT'-rik). 

(The ped- you see in words like pedestal, pedal, and pedestrian 
is from the Latin pedis, foot, and despite the identical spelling in 
English has no relationship to Greek paidos.) 


60 



Pedagogy (PED-a-go'-jee), which combines paidos with 
agogos, leading, is, etymologically, the leading of children . And to 
what do you lead them? To learning, to development, to growth, 
to maturity. From the moment of birth, infants are led by adults— 
they are taught, first by parents and then by teachers, to be self- 
sufficient, to fit into the culture in which they are born. Hence, 
pedagogy, which by derivation means the leading of a child , refers 
actually to the principles and methods of teaching. College stu¬ 
dents majoring in education take certain standard pedagogy 
courses—the history of education; educational psychology; the 
psychology of adolescents; principles of teaching; etc. Adjective: 
pedagogical (ped-a-GOJ'-a-kal). 

A pedagogue (PED'-a-gog) is versed in pedagogy . But peda¬ 
gogue has an unhappy history. From its original, neutral meaning 
of teacher, it has deteriorated to the point where it refers, today, 
to a narrow-minded, strait-laced, old-fashioned, dogmatic teacher. 
It is a word of contempt and should be used with caution. 

Like pedagogue, demagogue (DEM-a-gog) has also deterio¬ 
rated in meaning. By derivation a leader (agogos) of the people 
(demos), a demagogue today is actually one who attempts, in es¬ 
sence, to mislead the people, a politician who foments discontent 
among the masses, rousing them to fever pitch by wild oratory, in 
an attempt to be voted into office. 

Once elected, demagogues use political power to further their 
own personal ambitions or fortunes. 

Many “leaders” of the past and present, in countries around the 
world, have been accused of demagoguery (dem-a-GOG'-a-ree). 
Adjective: demagogic (dem-a-GOJ'-ik). 


4. skin-deep 

The dermatologist, whose specialty is dermatology (dur-ma- 
TOL'-a-jee), is so named from Greek derma, skin. Adjective: 
dermatological (dur'-ma-ta-LOJ'-a-kal). 

See the syllables derma in any English word and you will know 
there is some reference to skin —for example, a hypodermic (hl- 
pa-DUR'-mik) needle penetrates under (Greek, hypos) the skin; 
the epidermis (ep-a-DUR'-mis) is the outermost layer of skin; 
a taxidermist (TAKS'-a-dur-mist), whose business is taxidermy 


61 



(TAKS'-o-dur-mee), prepares, stuffs, and mounts the skins of 
animals; a pachyderm (PAK'-3-durm) is an animal with an un¬ 
usually thick skin, like an elephant, hippopotamus, or rhinoceros; 
and dermatitis (dur-ms-Tl'-tis) is the general name for any skin 
inflammation, irritation, or infection. 


5. the eyes have it 

Ophthalmologist —note the ph preceding th —is from Greek 
ophthalmos, eye, plus logos, science or study. The specialty is 
ophthalmology (off'-thal-MOL'-s-jee), the adjective ophthal - 
mological (ofF-thal-ms-LOJ'-s-ksl). 

An earlier title for this physician, still occasionally used, is ocu¬ 
list (OK'-ya-list), from Latin oculus, eye, a root on which the fol¬ 
lowing English words are also built: 

1. ocular (OK'-ys-lsr)—an adjective that refers to the eye 

2. monocle (MON'-s-kol)—a lens for one {monos) eye, sported 
by characters in old movies as a symbol of the British so-called 
upper class 

3. binoculars (bs-NOK'-ys-brz)—field glasses that increase 
the range of two (M-) eyes 

4. And, strangely enough, inoculate (in-OK'-yo-layt'), a word 
commonly misspelled with two ris. When you are inoculated 
against a disease, an “eye,” puncture, or hole is made in your 
skin, through which serum is injected. 

Do not confuse the ophthalmologist or oculist, a medical spe¬ 
cialist, with two other practitioners who deal with the eye—the 
optometrist (op-TOM'-s-trist) and optician (op-TISH'-sn). 

Optometrists are not physicians, and do not perform surgery or 
administer drugs; they measure vision, test for glaucoma, and 
prescribe and fit glasses. 

Opticians fill an optometrist's or ophthalmologists prescription, 
grinding lenses according to specifications; they do not examine 
patients. 

Optometrist combines Greek opsis, optikos, sight or vision, with 
metron, measurement—the optometrist, by etymology, is one who 
measures vision. The specialty is optometry (op-TOM'-o-tree). 


62 



Optician is built on opsis, optikos, plus - ician , expert. The 
specialty is optics (OP'-tiks). 

Adjectives: optometric (op-ts-MET'-rik) or optometrical (op- 
to-MET'-ra-kol), optical (OP'-ta-kal).

SESSION 6 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. the sfraighteners 

The orthopedist is so called from the Greek roots orthos, 
straight or correct, and paidos, child. The orthopedist, by etymol¬ 
ogy, straightens children. The term was coined in 1741 by the au¬ 
thor of a textbook on the prevention of childhood diseases—at 
that time the correction of spinal curvature in children was a main 
concern of practitioners of orthopedics (awr-tho-PEE'-diks). 


67 





Today the specialty treats deformities, injuries, and diseases of 
the bones and joints (of adults as well as children, of course), 
often by surgical procedures. 

Adjective: orthopedic (awr-tha-PEE'-dik). 

Orthodontia (awr-tha-DON'-sha), the straightening of teeth, is 
built on orthos plus odontos, tooth. The orthodontist (awr-tha- 
DON'-tist) specializes in improving your “bite,” retracting “buck 
teeth,” and by means of braces and other techniques seeing to it 
that every molar, incisor, bicuspid, etc. is exactly where it belongs 
in your mouth. 

Adjective: orthodontic (awr-tha-DON'-tik). 


2. the heart 

Cardiologist combines Greek kardia , heart, and logos, science. 
The specialty is cardiology (kahr-dee-OL'-a-jee), the adjective 
cardiological (kahr'-dee-a-LOJ'-a-kal). 

So a cardiac (KAHR'-dee-ak) condition refers to some mal¬ 
functioning of the heart; a cardiogram (KAHR'-dee-a-gram') is 
an electrically produced record of the heartbeat. The instrument 
that produces this record is called a cardiograph (KAHR'-dee-a- 

graf'). 


3. the nervous system 

Neurologist derives from Greek neuron , nerve, plus logos, sci¬ 
ence. 

Specialty: neurology (noor-OL'-a-jee); adjective: neurological 
(noor-a-LOJ'-a-kal). 

Neuralgia (noor-AL'-ja) is acute pain along the nerves and 
their branches; the word comes from neuron plus algos, pain. 

Neuritis (nobr-I'-tis), is inflammation of the nerves. 

Neurosis (ndor-O'-sis), combining neuron with -osis, a suffix 
meaning abnormal or diseased condition, is not, despite its ety¬ 
mology, a disorder of the nerves, but rather, as described by the 
late Eric Berne, a psychiatrist, . . an illness characterized by 
excessive use of energy for unproductive purposes so that person¬ 
ality development is hindered or stopped. A man who spends most 


68 



or nis time worrying about ms neaitn, counting ms money, plotting 
revenge, or washing his hands, can hope for little emotional 
growth.” . 

Neurotic (noor-OT'-ik) is both the adjective form and the term 
for a person suffering from neurosis . 

4. the mind 

A neurosis is not a form of mental unbalance. A full-blown 
mental disorder is called a psychosis (sI-KO'-sis), a word built 
on Greek psyche, spirit, soul, or mind, plus - osis . 

A true psychotic (sT-KOT'-ik) has lost contact with reality—at 
least with reality as most of us perceive it, though no doubt psy¬ 
chotic (note that this word, like neurotic, is both a noun and an 
adjective) people have their own form of reality. 

Built on psyche plus iatreia, medical healing, a psychiatrist by 
etymology is a mind-healer. The specialty is psychiatry (si- or so- 
Kl-a-tree); the adjective is psychiatric (sT-kee-AT'-rik). 

Pediatrics, as you know, is also built on iatreia, as is podiatry 
(pa-DT-a-tree), discussed in the next chapter, and geriatrics 
(jair'-ee-AT'-riks), the specialty dealing with the particular medi¬ 
cal needs of the elderly. (This word combines iatreia with Greek 
geras, old age.) 

The specialist is a geriatrician (jair'-ee-a-TRISH'-sn), the ad¬ 
jective is geriatric (jair'-ee-AT'-rik).

TWO KEYS TO SUCCESS: SELF-DISCIPLINE AND PERSISTENCE 

You can achieve a superior vocabulary in a phenomenally short 
time—given self-discipline and persistence. 

The greatest aid in building self-discipline is, as I have said, a 
matter of devising a practical and comfortable schedule for your¬ 
self and then keeping to that schedule. 

Make sure to complete at least one session each time you pick 
up the book, and always decide exactly when you will continue 
with your work before you put the book down. 

There may be periods of difficulty—then is the time to exert the 
greatest self-discipline, the most determined persistence. 

For every page that you study will help you attain a mastery 
over words; every day that you work will add to your skill in un¬ 
derstanding and using words.

-Brief Intermission Two- 


RANDOM NOTES ON MODERN USAGE 


English grammar is confusing enough as it is—what makes it dou¬ 
bly confounding is that it is slowly but continually changing. 

This means that some of the strict rules you memorized so pain¬ 
fully in your high school or college English courses may no longer 
be completely valid. 

Following such outmoded principles, you may think you are 
speaking “perfect” English, and instead you may sound stuffy and 
pedantic. 

The problem boils down to this: If grammatical usage is gradu¬ 
ally becoming more liberal, where does educated, unaffected, in¬ 
formal speech end? And where does illiterate, ungrammatical 
speech begin? 

The following notes on current trends in modem usage are in¬ 
tended to help you come to a decision about certain controversial 
expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention 
to the italicized word or words. Does the usage square with your 
own language patterns? Would you be willing to phrase your 
thought in just terms? Decide whether the sentence is right or 
wrong, then compare your conclusion with the opinion given in 
the explanatory paragraphs that follow the test.

15. I would like to ask you a question. 

RIGHT 

WRONG 


1. If you drink too many vodka martinis, you will surely get 
sick. 

right. The puristic objection is that get has only one mean¬ 
ing—namely, obtain . However, as any modem dictionary will at¬ 
test, get has scores of different meanings, one of the most respecta¬ 
ble of which is become. You can get tired, get dizzy, get drunk, 
or get sick—-and your choice of words will offend no one but a 
pedant. 


77 



2. Have you got a dollar? 

right. If purists get a little pale at the sound of “get sick,” 
they turn chalk white when they hear have got as a substitute for 
have . But the fact is that have got is an established American 
form of expression. Jacques Barzun, noted author and literary 
critic, says: “Have you got is good idiomatic English—I use it in 
speech without thinking about it and would write it if colloqui¬ 
alism seemed appropriate to the passage.” 

3. No ones loves you except /. 

wrong. In educated speech, me follows the preposition ex¬ 
cept . This problem is troublesome because, to the unsophisticated, 
the sentence sounds as if it can be completed to “No one loves 
you, except / do,” but current educated usage adheres to the tech¬ 
nical rule that a preposition requires an objective pronoun (me). 

4. Please lay down. 

wrong. Liberal as grammar has become, there is still no 
sanction for using lay with the meaning of recline . Lay means to 
place, as in “Lay your hand on mine.” Lie is the correct choice. 

5. Who do you love? 

right. “The English language shows some disposition to get 
rid of whom altogether, and unquestionably it would be a better 
language with whom gone.” So wrote Janet Rankin Aiken, of Co¬ 
lumbia University, way back in 1936. Today, many decades later, 
the “disposition” has become a full-fledged force. 

The rules for who and whom are complicated, and few edu¬ 
cated speakers have the time, patience, or expertise to bother with 
them. Use the democratic who in your everyday speech whenever 
it sounds right 

6. Neither of these cars are worth the money. 

wrong. The temptation to use are in this sentence is, I admit, 
practically irresistible. However, “neither of” means “neither one 
of* and is, therefore, is the preferable verb. 

7. The judge sentenced the murderer to be hung . 

wrong. A distinction is made, in educated speech, between 
hung and hanged . A picture is hung, but a person is hanged —that 
is, if such action is intended to bring about an untimely demise. 

8. Mother, can I go out to play? 


78 



right. If you insist that your child say may, and nothing but 
may, when asking for permission, you may be considered puristic. 
Can is not discourteous, incorrect, or vulgar—and the newest edi¬ 
tions of the authoritative dictionaries fully sanction the use of can 
in requesting rights, privileges, or permission. 

9. Take two spoonsful of this medicine every three hours. 

wrong. There is a strange affection, on the part of some peo¬ 
ple, for spoonsful and cupsful, even though spoonsful and cupsful 
do not exist as acceptable words. The plurals are spoonfuls and 
cupfuls. 

I am taking for granted, of course, that you are using one spoon 
and filling it twice. If, for secret reasons of your own, you prefer 
to take your medicine in two separate spoons, you may then prop¬ 
erly speak of “two spoons full (not spoonsful) of medicine.” 

10. Your words seem to infer that Jack is a liar. 

wrong. Infer does not mean hint or suggest. Imply is the 
proper word; to infer is to draw a conclusion from another’s 
words. 

11. I will be happy to go to the concert with you. 

right. In informal speech, you need no longer worry about 
the technical and unrealistic distinctions between shall and will. 
The theory of modern grammarians is that shall-will differences 
were simply invented out of whole cloth by the textbook writers of 
the 1800s. As the editor of the scholarly Modern Language 
Forum at the University of California has stated, “The artificial 
distinction between shall and will to designate futurity is a super¬ 
stition that has neither a basis in historical grammar nor the sound 
sanction of universal usage.” 

12. It is me. 

right. This “violation” of grammatical “law” has been com¬ 
pletely sanctioned by current usage. When the late Winston 
Churchill made a nationwide radio address from New Haven, 
Connecticut, many, many years ago, his opening sentence was: 
“This is me, Winston Churchill.” I imagine that the purists who 
were listening fell into a deep state of shock at these words, but of 
course Churchill was simply using the kind of down-to-earth Eng¬ 
lish that had long since become standard in informal educated 
speech. 


79 



13. Go slow. 

right. “Go slow” is not, and never has been, incorrect 
English—every authority concedes that slow is an adverb as well 
as an adjective. Rex Stout, well-known writer of mystery novels 
and creator of Detective Nero Wolfe, remarked: “Not only do I 
use and approve of the idiom Go slow , but if I find myself with 
people who do not, I leave quick.” 

14. Peggy and Karen are alumni of the same high school. 
wrong. As Peggy and Karen are obviously women, we call 

them alumnae (s-LUM'-nee); only male graduates are alumni 
(a-LUM'-nl). 

15. I would like to ask you a question. 

right. In current American usage, would may be used with I, 
though old-fashioned rules demand I should . 

Indeed, in modern speech, should is almost entirely restricted to 
expressing probability, duty, or responsibility. 

As in the case of the charitable-looking dowager who was 
approached by a seedy character seeking a handout. 

“Madam,” he whined, “1 haven’t eaten in five days.” 

“My good man,” the matron answered with great concern, “you 
should force yourself!”

SESSION 7 


An ancient Greek mused about the meaning of life, and philoso¬ 
phy was bom. The first Roman decided to build a road instead of 
cutting a path through the jungle, and engineering came into exist¬ 
ence. One day in primitive times, a human being lent to another 
whatever then passed for money and got back his original invest¬ 
ment plus a little more—and banking had started. 

Most people spend part of every workday at some gainful em¬ 
ployment, honest or otherwise, and in so doing often contribute 
their little mite to the progress of the world. 

We explore in this chapter the ideas behind people’s occupa¬ 
tions—and the words that translate these ideas into verbal symr 
bols. 


IDEAS 


1. behavior 

By education and training, this practitioner is an expert in the 
dark mysteries of human behavior—what makes people act as 
they do, why they have certain feelings, how their personalities 
were formed—in short, what makes them tick. Such a professional. 
is often employed by industries, schools, and institutions to devise' 
means for keeping workers productive and happy, students well- 
adjusted, and inmates contented. With a state license, this person 
may also do private or group therapy. 

A psychologist 


2. worries, fears, conflicts 

This practitioner is. a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist 
who has been specially trained in the techniques devised by Sig- 


82 



^aucu me uueuii&eiuus. r>y reviewing me experiences, iraumas, 
feelings, and thoughts of your earlier years, you come to a better 
understanding of your present worries, fears, conflicts, repres¬ 
sions, insecurities, and nervous tensions—thus taking the first step 
in coping with them. Treatment, consisting largely in listening to, 
and helping you to interpret the meaning of, your free-flowing 
ideas, is usually given in frequent sessions that may well go on for 
a year or more. 

A psychoanalyst 


3. teeth 

This practitioner is a dentist who has taken postgraduate work 
in the straightening of teeth. 

An orthodontist 


4. eyes 

This practitioner measures your vision and prescribes the type 
of glasses that will give you a new and more accurate view of the 
world. 


An optometrist 


5. glasses 

This practitioner grinds lenses according to the specifications 
prescribed by your optometrist or ophthalmologist, and may also 
deal in other kinds of optical goods. 

An optician 


6 . bones and blood vessels 

This practitioner is a member of the profession that originated 
in 1874, when Andrew T. Still devised a drugless technique of 
curing diseases by massage and other manipulative procedures, a 
technique based on the theory that illness may be caused by the 
undue pressure of displaced bones on nerves and blood vessels. 


83 


naming is equal to that ot physicians, ana m most states tnese 
practitioners may also use the same methods as, and have the full 
rights and privileges of, medical doctors. 

An osteopath 


7. joints and articulations i 

The basic principle of this practitioner’s work is the mainte¬ 
nance of the structural and functional integrity of the nervous sys¬ 
tem. Treatment consists of manipulating most of the articulations 
of the body, especially those connected to the spinal column. Li¬ 
censed and legally recognized in forty-five states, this professional 
has pursued academic studies and training that parallel those of 
the major healing professions. 

A chiropractor 


8. feet 

This practitioner treats minor foot ailments—corns, calluses, 
bunions, fallen arches, etc., and may perform minor surgery. 

A podiatrist 


9. writing 

This practitioner analyzes handwriting to determine character, 
personality, or aptitudes, and is often called upon to verify the au¬ 
thenticity of signatures, written documents, etc. 

A graphologist 


10. getting old 

This social scientist deals with the financial, economic, sexual, 
social, retirement, and other non-medical problems of the elderly. 

A gerontologist

SESSION 8 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. the mental life 

Psychologist is built upon the same Greek root as psychi¬ 
atrist — psyche, spirit, soul, or mind. In psychiatrist, the combin¬ 
ing form is iatreia, medical healing. In psychologist, the combin¬ 
ing form is logos, science or study; a psychologist, by etymology, 
is one who studies the mind. 

The field is psychology (sI-KOL'-s-jee), the adjective psycho¬ 
logical (sI'-ka-LOJ'-a-kal). 

Psyche (Sl'-kee) is also an English word in its own right—it 
designates the mental life, the spiritual or non-physical aspect of 
one’s existence. The adjective psychic (SI'-kik) refers to phe¬ 
nomena or qualities that cannot be explained in purely physical 
terms. People may be called psychic if they seem to possess a 
sixth sense, a special gift of mind reading, or any mysterious 
aptitudes that cannot be accounted for logically. A person’s dis¬ 
turbance is psychic if it is emotional or mental, rather than physi¬ 
cal. 


87 



Psyche combines with the Greek pathos , suffering or disease, to 
form psychopathic (sI-ks-PATH'-ik), an adjective that describes 
someone suffering from a severe mental or emotional disorder. 
The noun is psychopathy (sI'-KOP'-s-thee) .* 

The root psyche combines with Greek soma , body, to form psy¬ 
chosomatic (sF-ko-sa-MAT-ik), an adjective that delineates the 
powerful influence that the mind, especially the unconscious, has 
on bodily diseases. Thus, a person who fears the consequence of 
being present at a certain meeting will suddenly develop a bad 
cold or backache, or even be injured in a traffic accident, so that 
his appearance at this meeting is made impossible. It’s a real cold, 
it’s far from an imaginary backache, and of course one cannot in 
any sense doubt the reality of the automobile that injured him. 
Yet, according to the psychosomatic theory of medicine, his un¬ 
conscious made him susceptible to the cold germs, caused the 
backache, or forced him into the path of the car. 

A psychosomatic disorder actually exists insofar as symptoms 
are concerned (headache, excessive urination, pains, paralysis, 
heart palpitations), yet there is no organic cause within the body. 
The cause is within the psyche, the mind. Dr. Flanders Dunbar, in 
Mind and Body, gives a clear and exciting account of the in¬ 
terrelationship between emotions and diseases. 

Psychoanalysis (sf-ko-a-NAL'-a-sis) relies on the technique of 
deeply, exhaustively probing into the unconscious, a technique de¬ 
veloped by Sigmund Freud. In oversimplified terms, the general 
principle of psychoanalysis is to guide the patient to an awareness 
of the deep-seated, unconscious causes of anxieties, fears, 
conflicts, and tension. Once found, exposed to the fight of day, 
and thoroughly understood, claim the psychoanalysts, these causes 
may vanish like a fight snow that is exposed to strong sunlight: 

Consider an example: You have asthma, let us say, and your 

* Psychopathy is usually characterized by antisocial and extremely ego¬ 
centric behavior. A psychopath (SP-ka-path'), sometimes called a psycho¬ 
pathic personality , appears to be lacking an inner moral censor, and often 
commits criminal acts, without anxiety or guilt, in order to obtain im¬ 
mediate gratification of desires. Such a person may be utterly lacking in 
sexual restraint, or addicted to hard drugs. Some psychologists prefer the 
label sociopath (SO'-shee-a-path' or SO'-see-a-path') for this type of per¬ 
sonality to indicate the absence of a social conscience. 


88 



doctor can find no physical basis for your ailment. So you are re¬ 
ferred to a psychoanalyst (or psychiatrist or clinical psychologist 
who practices psychoanalytically oriented therapy). 

With your therapist you explore your past life, dig into your un¬ 
conscious, and discover, let us say for the sake of argument, that 
your mother or father always used to set for you impossibly high 
goals. No matter what you accomplished in school, it was not 
good enough—in your mother’s or father’s opinion (and such 
opinions were always made painfully clear to you), you could do 
better if you were not so lazy. As a child you built up certain re¬ 
sentments and anxieties because you seemed unable to please your 
parent—and (this will sound farfetched, but it is perfectly possi¬ 
ble) as a result you became asthmatic. How else were you going 
to get the parental love, the approbation, the attention you needed 
and that you felt you were not receiving? 

In your sessions with your therapist, you discover that your 
asthma is emotionally, rather than organically, based—your ail¬ 
ment is psychogenic (si'-ko-JEN'-ik), of psychic origin, or (the 
terms are used more or less interchangeably although they differ 
somewhat in definition) psychosomatic, resulting from the interac¬ 
tion of mind and body. ( Psychogenic is built on psyche plus 
Greek genesis, birth or origin.) 

And your treatment? No drugs, no surgery—these may help the 
body, not the emotions. Instead, you “work out” (this is the term 
used in psychoanalytic [sI-ko-an'-s-LIT'-ik] parlance) early 
trauma in talk, in remembering, in exploring, in interpreting, in 
reliving childhood experiences. And if your asthma is indeed 
psychogenic (or psychosomatic ), therapy will very likely help 
you; your attacks may cease, either gradually or suddenly. 

Freudian therapy is less popular today than formerly; many 
newer therapies—Gestalt, bioenergetics, transactional analysis, to 
name only a few—claim to produce quicker results. 

In any case, psychotherapy (sI-ko-THAIR'-o-pee) of one sort 
or another is the indicated treatment for psychogenic (or psycho¬ 
somatic) disorders, or for any personality disturbances. The prac¬ 
titioner is a psychotherapist (sT-ko-THAIR'-a-pist) or therapist, 
for short; the adjective is psychotherapeutic (sl-ko-thair'-o- 
PYOO'-tik).

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. the whole tooth 

Orthodontist, as we discovered in Chapter 4, is built on 
orthos, straight, correct, plus odontos, tooth. 

A pedodontist (pee'-do-DON'-tist) specializes in the care of 
children’s teeth—the title is constructed from paidos, child, plus 
odontos . The specialty: pedodontia (pee'-do-DON'-sha); the ad¬ 
jective: pedodontic (pee'-do-DON'-tik). 

A periodontist (pair'-ee-o-DON'-tist) is a gum specialist—the 
term combines odontos with the prefix peri-, around, surrounding. 
(As a quick glance in the mirror will tell you, the gums surround 
the teeth, more or less.) 

Can you figure out the word for the specialty? 


For the adjective?- 

An endodontist (en'-do-DON'-tist) specializes iti work on the 
pulp of the tooth and in root-canal therapy—the prefix in this 
term is endo-, from Greek endon, inner, within. 

Try your hand again at constructing words. What is the 
specialty? --And the adjective? 


The prefix ex-, out, combines with odontos to form exodontist 
(eks'-o-DON'-tist). What do you suppose, therefore, is the work 

in which this practitioner specializes?____ 

And the term for the specialty?____ - ... 

For the adjective?----_-____ 


93 




2. measurement 


The optometrist, by etymology, measures vision—the term is 
built on opsis, optikos, view, vision, plus metron, measurement. 

Metron is the root in many other words: 

1. thermometer (thar-MOM'-a-tar)—an instrument to meas¬ 
ure heat (Greek therme, heat). 

2. barometer (ba-ROM'-a-ter)—an instrument to measure 
atmospheric pressure (Greek baros, weight); the adjective is bar¬ 
ometric (bair'-a-MET'-rik). 

3. sphygmomanometer (sfig'-mo-ma-NOM'-a-tar)—a device 
for measuring blood pressure (Greek sphygmos, pulse). 

4. metric system—a decimal system of weights and measures, 
long used in other countries and now gradually being adopted in 
the United States. 

3. bones, feet, and hands 

Osteopath combines Greek osteon, bone, with pathos, suffering, 
disease. Osteopathy (os'-tee-OP'-a-thee), you will recall, was 
originally based on the theory that disease is caused by pressure of 
the bones on blood vessels and nerves. An osteopathic (os'-tee-a- 
PATH'-ik) physician is not a bone specialist, despite the mislead¬ 
ing etymology—and should not be confused with the orthopedist, 
who is. 

The podiatrist (Greek pous, podos, foot, plus iatreia, medical 
healing) practices podiatry (pa-DI'-a-tree). The adjective is po- 
diatric (po'-dee-AT'-rik). 

The root pous, podos is found also in: 

1. octopus (OK'-ta-pas), the eight-armed (or, as the etymol¬ 
ogy has it, eight-footed) sea creature (Greek okto , eight). 

2. platypus (PLAT'-arpas), the strange water mammal with a 
duck’s bill, webbed feet, and a beaver-like tail that reproduces by 
laying eggs (Greek platys, broad, flat—hence, by etymology, a 
flatfootl). 

3. podium (PO'-dee-am), a speaker’s platform, etymologically 
a place for the feet. (The suffix -ium often signifies “place where,” 
as in gymnasium, stadium, auditorium, etc.) 


94 



4. tripod (TRT-pod), a three-legged (or “footed”) stand for a 
camera or other device (tri-, three). 

5. chiropodist (ka-ROP'-a-dist), earlier title for a podiatrist , 
and still often used. The specialty is chiropody (ka-ROP'-a-dee). 

Chiropody combines podos with Greek cheir , hand, spelled 
chiro- in English words. The term was coined in the days before 
labor-saving machinery and push-button devices, when people 
worked with their hands and developed calluses on their upper ex¬ 
tremities as well as on their feet. Today most of us earn a liveli¬ 
hood in more sedentary occupations, and so we may develop 
calluses on less visible portions of our anatomy. 

Chiropractors heal with their hands—the specialty is chiro¬ 
practic (kl'-ro-PRAK'-tik). 

Cheir ( chiro -), hand, is the root in chirography (ki-ROG'-ra- 
fee). Recalling the graph- in graphologist , can you figure out by 
etymology what chirography is?_ 


An expert in writing by hand, or in penmanship (a lost art in 
these days of electronic word-processing) ,t would be a chirog- 
rapher (kl-ROG'-ra-far); the adjective is chirographic (kl'-ro- 
GRAF-ik). 

If the suffix -money comes from a Greek word meaning fore¬ 
telling or prediction , can you decide what chiromancy (Kl'-ro- 

man'-see) must be?_ 

The person who practices chiromancy is a chiromancer (Kl'-ro- 
man'-sar); the adjective is chiromantic (kl'-ro-MAN'-tik).

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

< 

1. writing and writers 

The Greek verb graphein, to write, is the source of a great 
many English words. 

We know that the graphologist analyzes handwriting, the term 
combining graphein with logos, science, study. The specialty is 
graphology (grs-FOL'-s-jee), the adjective graphological (graf'-s- 
LOJ'-o-kol). 

Chirographer is built on graphein plus cheir (chiro-), hand.

IDEAS 


7. you don’t fool even some of the people 

Everybody knows your propensity for avoiding facts. You have 
built so solid and unsavory a reputation that only a stranger is 
likely to be misled—and then, not for long. 

A notorious liar 


2. to the highest summits of artistry 

Your ability is top-drawer—rarely does anyone lie as convinc¬ 
ingly or as artistically as you do. Your skill has, in short, reached 
the zenith of perfection. Indeed, your mastery of the art is so great 
that your lying is almost always crowned with success—and you 
have no trouble seducing an unwary listener into believing that 
you are telling gospel truth. 

A consummate liar 


3. beyond redemption or salvation 

You are impervious to correction. Often as you may be caught 
in your fabrications, there is no reforming you—you go right on ly¬ 
ing despite the punishment, embarrassment, or unhappiness that 
your distortions of truth may bring upon you. 

An incorrigible liar 


4. too old to learn new tricks 

You are the victim of firmly fixed and deep-rooted habits. Tell¬ 
ing untruths is as frequent and customary an activity as brushing 
your teeth in the morning, or having toast and coffee for break¬ 
fast, or lighting up a cigarette after dinner (if you are a smoker). 
And almost as reflexive. 


An inveterate liar 
150 



SESSION 14 


It was the famous Greek philosopher and cynic Diogenes who 
went around the streets of Athens, lantern in hand, looking for an 
honest person. 

This was over two thousand years ago, but I presume that 
Diogenes would have as little success in his search today. Lying 
seems to be an integral weakness of mortal character—I doubt 
that few human beings would be so brash as to claim that they 
have never in their lives told at least a partial untruth. Indeed, one 
philologist goes so far as to theorize that language must have been 
invented for the sole purpose of deception. Perhaps so. It is cer¬ 
tainly true that animals seem somewhat more honest than humans, 
maybe because they are less gifted mentally. 

Why do people lie? To increase their sense of importance, to es¬ 
cape punishment, to gain an end that would otherwise be denied 
them, out of long-standing habit, or sometimes because they actu¬ 
ally do not know the difference between fact and fancy. These are 
the common reasons for falsification. No doubt there are other, 
fairly unique, motives that impel people to distort the truth. And, 
to come right down to it, can we always be certain what is true 
and what is false? 

If lying is a prevalent and all-too-human phenomenon, there 
would of course be a number of interesting words to describe 
different types of liars. 

Let us pretend (not to get personal, but only to help you be¬ 
come personally involved in the ideas and words) that you are a 
liar. 

The question is, what kind of liar are you?

6. Are you going to invite Doris and I to your party? 

wrong. Some people are almost irresistibly drawn to the pro¬ 
noun I in constructions like this one. However, not only does such 
use of I violate a valid and useful grammatical principle, but, 
more important, it is rarely heard in educated speech. The mean¬ 
ing of the sentence is equally clear no matter which form of the 
pronoun is employed, of course, but the use of I, the less popular 
choice, may stigmatize the speaker as uneducated. 

Consider it this way: You would normally say, “Are you going 
to invite me to your party?” It would be wiser, therefore, to say, 
“Are you going to invite Doris and me to your party?” 


147 



opinions were unanimous; not a single dissenting voice, out of the 
twenty-three authors who answered, was raised against the usage. 
One writer responded: “It has been right for about 150 years 

Editors of magazines and newspapers questioned on the same 
point were just a shade more conservative. Sixty out of sixty-nine 
accepted the usage. One editor commented: “I think we do not 
have to be nice about nice any longer. No one can eradicate it 
from popular speech as a synonym for pleasant, or enjoyable, or 
kind , or courteous. It is a workhorse of the vocabulary, and prop¬ 
erly so.” 

The only valid objection to the word is that it is overworked by 
some people, but this shows a weakness in vocabulary rather than 
in grammar. 

As in the famous story of the editor who said to her secretary: 
“There are two words I wish you would stop using so much. One 
is ‘nice* and the other is ‘lousy.’ ” 

“Okay,” said the secretary, who was eager to please. “What are 
they?” 

4. He’s pretty sick today. 

right. One of the purist’s pet targets of attack is the word 
pretty as used in the sentence under discussion. Yet all modern 
dictionaries accept such use of pretty, and a survey made by a 
professor at the University of Wisconsin showed that the usage is 
established English. 

5. 1 feel awfully sick. 

right. Dictionaries accept this usage in informal speech and 
the University of Wisconsin survey showed that it is established 
English. 

The great popularity of awfully in educated speech is no doubt 
due to the strong and unique emphasis that the word gives to an 
adjective—substitute very, quite, extremely, or severely and you 
considerably weaken the force. 

On the other hand, it is somewhat less than cultivated to say “I 
feel awful sick,” and the wisdom of using awfully to intensify a 
pleasant concept (“What an awfully pretty child”; “That book is 
awfully interesting”) is perhaps still debatable, though getting less 
and less so as the years go on. 


146 



usage without qualification. Of twelve dictionary editors, eleven 
accepted further, and in the case of the authors, thirteen out of 
twenty-three accepted the word as used. A professor of English at 
Cornell University remarked: “I know of no justification for any 
present-day distinction between further and farther**; and a con¬ 
sulting editor of the Funk and Wagnalls dictionary said, “There is 
nothing controversial here. As applied to spatial distance, further 
and farther have long been interchangeable.” 

Perhaps the comment of a noted author and columnist is most 
to the point: “I like both further and farther, as I have never been 
able to tell which is which or why one is any farther or further 
than the other.” 

2. Some people admit that their principle goal in life is to become 
wealthy. 

wrong. In speech, you can get principal and principle con¬ 
fused as often as you like, and no one will ever know the 
difference—both words are pronounced identically. In writing, 
however, your spelling will give you away. 

There is a simple memory trick that will help you if you get into 
trouble with these two words. Rule and principle both end in 
-le —and a princip le is a rale. On the other hand, principal con¬ 
tains an a, and so does main —and principal means main. Get 
these points straight and your confusion is over. 

Heads of schools are called principals, because they are the 
main person in that institution of learning. The money you have 
in the bank is your principal, your main financial assets. And the 
stars of a play are principals —the main actors. 

Thus, “Some people admit that their principal (main) goal in 
life is to become wealthy,” but “Such a principle (rule) is not 
guaranteed to lead to happiness.” 

3. What a nice thing to say! 

right. Purists object to the popular use of nice as a synonym 
for pleasant, agreeable, or delightful. They wish to restrict the 
word to its older and more erudite meaning of exact or subtle . 
You will be happy to hear that they aren’t getting anywhere. 

When I polled a group of well-known authors on the accept¬ 
ability in everyday speech of the popular meaning of nice, their 


145 



rules, but only because they are rarely if ever used by educated 
speakers. 

Correctness, in short, is determined by current educated usage. 

The following notes on current trends in modern usage are in¬ 
tended to help you come to a decision about certain controversial 
expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention 
to the italicized word or words. Does the usage square with your 
own language patterns? Would you be willing to phrase your 
thoughts in just such terms? Decide whether the sentence is 
“right” or “wrong,” then compare your conclusions with the opin¬ 
ions given after the test.

right. In the nineteenth century, when professional grammari¬ 
ans attempted to Latinize English grammar, an artificial distinc¬ 
tion was drawn between farther and further , to wit: farther refers 
to space, further means to a greater extent or additional. Today, 
as a result, many teachers who are still under the forbidding in¬ 
fluence of nineteenth-century restrictions insist that it is incorrect 
to use one word for the other. 

To check on current attitudes toward this distinction, I sent 
the test sentence above to a number of dictionary editors, authors, 
and professors of English, requesting their opinion of the accepta¬ 
bility of further in reference to actual distance. Sixty out of eighty- 
seven professors, over two thirds of those responding, accepted the

HOW TO AVOID BEING A PURIST 


Life, as you no doubt realize, is complicated enough these days. 
Yet puristic textbooks and English teachers with puristic ideas are 
striving to make it still more complicated. Their contribution to 
the complexity of modern living is the repeated claim that many 
of the natural, carefree, and popular expressions that most of us 
use every day are “bad English,” “incorrect grammar,” “vulgar,” 
or “illiterate.” 

In truth, many of the former restrictions and “thou shalt nots” 
of academic grammar are now outmoded—most educated speak¬ 
ers quite simply ignore them. 

Students in my grammar classes at Rio Hondo College are 
somewhat nonplused when they discover that correctness is not 
determined by textbook rules and cannot be enforced by school¬ 
teacher edict. They invariably ask: “Aren’t you going to draw the 
line somewhere?” 

It is neither necessary nor possible for any one person to “draw 
the line.” That is done—and quite effectively—by the people 
themselves, by the millions of educated people throughout the na¬ 
tion. 

Of course certain expressions may be considered “incorrect” or 
“illiterate” or “bad grammar”—not because they violate puristic

I suggest, first, half a dozen older books (older, but still im¬ 
mensely valuable and completely valid) available at any large 
public library. 

The Human Mind, by Karl A. Menninger 
Mind and Body, by Flanders Dunbar 
The Mind in Action, by Eric Berne 
Understandable Psychiatry, by Leland E. Hinsie 
A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, by Sigmund Freud 
Emotional Problems of Living, by O. Spurgeon English and 
Gerald H. J. Pearson 

Next, I suggest books on some of the newer approaches in psy¬ 
chology. These are available in inexpensive paperback editions as 
well as at your local library. 

I Ain’t Well—But I Sure Am Better, by Jess Lair, Ph.D. 

The Disowned Self, by Nathaniel Brandon 
A Primer of Behavioral Psychology, by Adelaide Bry 
Vm OK—You’re OK, by Thomas A. Harris, M.D. 

Freedom to Be and Man the Manipulator, by Everett L. Shos-

had an idea—and had to coin a whole new vocabulary to make 
his idea clear to the world. Those who are familiar with Freud’s 
theories know all the words that explain them—the unconscious, 
the ego, the id, the superego, rationalization, Oedipus complex, 
and so on. Splitting the atom was once a new idea—anyone famil¬ 
iar with it knew something about fission, isotope, radioactive, 
cyclotron, etc. 

Remember this: your vocabulary indicates the alertness and 
range of your mind. The words you know show the extent of your 
understanding of what’s going on in the world. The size of your 
vocabulary varies directly with the degree to which you are grow¬ 
ing intellectually. 

You have covered so far in this book several hundred words. 
Having learned these words, you have begun to think of an equal 
number of new ideas. A new word is not just another pattern of 
syllables with which to clutter up your mind—a new word is a 
new idea to help you think, to help you understand the thoughts 
of others, to help you express your own thoughts, to help you live 
a richer intellectual life. 

Realizing these facts, you may become impatient. You will 
begin to doubt that a book like this can cover all the ideas that an 
alert and intellectually mature adult wishes to be acquainted with. 
Your doubt is well-founded. 

One of the chief purposes of this book is to get you started, to 
give you enough of a push so that you will begin to gather 
momentum, to stimulate you enough so that you will want to start 
gathering your own ideas. 

Where can you gather them? From good books on new topics. 

How can you gather them? By reading on a wide range of new 
subjects. 

Reference has repeatedly been made to psychology, psychiatry, 
and psychoanalysis in these pages. If your curiosity has been 
piqued by these references, here is a good place to start. In these 
fields there is a tremendous and exciting literature—and you can 
read as widely and as deeply as you wish. 

What I would like to do is offer a few suggestions as to where 
you might profitably begin—how far you go will depend on your 
own interest.

ence, study. Socius is the source of such common words as associ¬ 
ate, social , socialize , society , sociable , and antisocial; as well as 
asocial (ay-SO'-shol), which combines the negative prefix a- with 
socius. 

The antisocial person actively dislikes people, and often be¬ 
haves in ways that are detrimental or destructive to society or the 
social order (< anti -, against). 

On the other hand, someone who is asocial is withdrawn and 
self-centered, avoids contact with others, and feels completely 
indifferent to the interests or welfare of society. The asocial per¬ 
son doesn’t want to “get involved.”

ENGLISH WORD 


133 



aphrodisiac (af'-ra-DIZ'-ee-alO > from Aphrodite, the Greek god¬ 
dess of love and beauty. 

Aphrodisiac is an adjective as well as a noun, but a longer ad¬ 
jective form, aphrodisiacal (af-rc-da-ZT-c-kol), is also used. 

A bibliophile (BIB'-lee-c-flT) is one who loves books as collecti¬ 
bles, admiring their binding, typography, illustrations, rarity, 
etc.—in short, a book collector. The combining root is Greek 
biblion, book. 

An Anglophile (ANG'-glc-fJT) admires and is fond of the Brit¬ 
ish people, customs, culture, etc. The combining root is Latin 
Anglus, English. 


5. words and how they affect people 

The semanticist is professionally involved in semantics (sa- 
MAN'-tiks). The adjective is semantic (so-MAN'-tik) or seman¬ 
tical (sa-MAN'-te-kol). 

Semantics, like orthopedics, pediatrics, and obstetrics, is a sin¬ 
gular noun despite the -s ending. Semantics is, not are, an exciting 
study. However, this rule applies only when we refer to the word 
as a science or area of study. In the following sentence, semantics 
is used as a plural: “The semantics of your thinking are all 
wrong.” 

Two stimulating and highly readable books on the subject, well 
worth a visit to the library to pick up, are Language in Thought 
and Action, by S. I. Hayakawa, and People in Quandaries, by Dr. 
Wendell Johnson. 


6. how people live 

The profession of the sociologist is sociology (so'-shee-OL'-c- 
jee or so-see-OL'-c-jee). Can you write, and pronounce, the ad¬ 
jective? __ ' _ 

Sociology is built on Latin socius, companion,* plus logos, sd- 

* Companion itself has an interesting etymology—Latin com-, with, plus 
pants, bread. If you are social, you enjoy breaking bread with companions. 
Pantry also comes from pan is, though far more than bread is stored there. 


132 



More commonly, epitome and the verb epitomize (a-PIT'-a- 
mlz') are used in sentences like “She is the epitome of kindness,” 
or “That one act epitomizes her philosophy of life.” If you cut ev¬ 
erything else away to get to the essential part, that part is a rep¬ 
resentative cross-section of the whole. So a woman who is the epit¬ 
ome of kindness stands for all people who are kind; and an act 
that epitomizes a philosophy of life represents, by itself, the com¬ 
plete philosophy. 

3. love and words 

Logos , we know, means science or study; it may also mean 
word or speech , as it does in philology (fa-LOL'-a-jee), etymo¬ 
logically the love of words (from Greek philein , to love, plus 
logos), or what is more commonly called linguistics (ling-GWIS'- 
tiks), the science of language, a term derived from Latin lingua, 
tongue. 

Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective form of philology? 


4. more love 

Philanthropy (fa-LAN'-thra-pee) is by etymology the love of 
mankind—one who devotes oneself to philanthropy is a philan¬ 
thropist (fa-LAN'-thra-pist), as we learned in Chapter 3; the ad¬ 
jective is philanthropic (fil-an-THROP'-ik). 

The verb philander (fa-LAN'-dar), to “play around” sexually, 
be promiscuous, or have extramarital relations, combines philein 
with andros, male. ( Philandering, despite its derivation, is not of 
course exclusively the male province. The word is, in fact, 
derived from the proper name conventionally given to male lovers 
in plays and romances of the 1500s and 1600s.) One who engages 
in the interesting activities catalogued above is a philanderer (fa- 
LAN'-dar-ar). 

By etymology, philosophy is the love of wisdom (Greek sophos, 
wise); Philadelphia is the City of Brotherly Love (Greek adel- 
phos, brother); philharmonic is the love of music or harmony 
(Greek harmonia, harmony); and a philter , a rarely used word, is 
a love potion. Today we call whatever arouses sexual desire an 


131 



2. more cuts 


The Greek prefix a - makes a root negative; the atom (AT'-sm) 
was so named at a time when it was considered the smallest possi¬ 
ble particle of an element, that is, one that could not be cut any 
further. (We have long since split the atom, of course, with re¬ 
sults, as in most technological advances, both good and evil.) The 
adjective is atomic (o-TOM'-ik). 

The Greek prefix ana - has a number of meanings, one of which 
is up, as in anatomy (s-NAT'-s-mee), originally the cutting up of 
a plant or animal to determine its structure, later the bodily struc¬ 
ture itself. The adjective is anatomical (an'-o-TOM'-a-ksl). 

Originally any book that was part of a larger work of many vol¬ 
umes was called a tome (TOM)—etymologically, a part cut from 
the whole. Today, a tome designates, often disparagingly, an ex¬ 
ceptionally large book, or one that is heavy and dull in content. 

The Greek prefix dicha -, in two, combines with tome to con¬ 
struct dichotomy (dl-KOT'-a-mee), a splitting in two, a technical 
word used in astronomy, biology, botany, and the science of logic. 
It is also employed as a non-technical term, as when we refer to 
the dichotomy in the life of a man who is a government clerk all 
day and a night-school teacher after working hours, so that his life 

is, in a sense, split into two parts. The verb is dichotomize (dl- 
KOT'-a-mJz'); the adjective is dichotomous (dl-KOT'-s-mas). 
Dichotomous thinking is the sort that divides everything into two 
parts—good and bad; white and black; Democrats and Republi¬ 
cans; etc. An unknown wit has made this classic statement about 
dichotomous thinking: “There are two kinds of people: those who 
divide everything into two parts, and those who do not.” 

Imagine a book, a complicated or massive report, or some other 
elaborate document—now figuratively cut on or through it so that 
you can get to its essence, the very heart of the idea contained in 

it. What you have is an epitome (o-PIT-a-mee), a condensation 
of the whole. (From epi- f on, upon, plus tome.) 

An epitome may refer to a summary, condensation, or abridg¬ 
ment of language, as in “Let me have an epitome of the book,” or 
“Give me the epitome of his speech.”

SESSION 13 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. cutting in and out 

Flies, bees, beetles, wasps, and other insects are segmented 
creatures—head, thorax, and abdomen. Where these parts join, 
there appears to the imaginative eye a “cutting in” of the body. 

Hence the branch of zoology dealing with insects is aptly 
named entomology , from Greek en-, in, plus tome, a cutting. The 
adjective is entomological (en'-te-ms-LOJ'-s-kai). 

(The word insect makes the same point—it is built on Latin 
in - in, plus sectus , a form of the verb meaning to cut) 

The prefix ec-, from Greek ek-, means out (The Latin prefix, 
you will recall, is ex-.) Combine ec - with tome to derive the words 
for surgical procedures in which parts are “cut out,” or removed: 
tonsillectomy (the tonsils), appendectomy (the appendix), mas¬ 
tectomy (the breast), hysterectomy (the uterus), prostatectomy 
(the prostate), etc. 

Combine ec - with Greek kentron, center (the Latin root, as we 
have discovered, is centrum ), to derive eccentric (sk-SEN'-trik)— 
out of the center, hence deviating from the normal in behavior, 
attitudes, etc., or unconventional, odd, strange. The noun is ec¬ 
centricity (ek'-son-TRIS'-o-tee).

gated for evidence of malignancy. A biopsy is contrasted with an 
autopsy (AW'-top-see), which is a medical examination of a 
corpse in order to discover the cause of death. Th autos in au¬ 
topsy means, as you know, self —in an autopsy, etymologically 
speaking, the surgeon or pathologist determines, by actual view or 
sight rather than by theorizing (i.e., “by viewing or seeing for 
oneself’), what brought the corpse to its present grievous state. 

Botanist is from Greek botane, plant. The field is botany 
(BOT'-s-nee); the adjective is botanical (bs-TAN'-a-kal). 

Zoologist is from Greek zoion , animal. The science is zoology . 
The adjective?_The combina¬ 

tion of the two o’s tempts many people to pronounce the first 
three letters of these words in one syllable, thus: zoo. However, 
the two o’s should be separated, as in co-operate, even though no 
hyphen is used in the spelling to indicate such separation. Say zo- 
OL'-a-jist, zo-OL'-a-jee, zo'-a-LOJ'-a-kal. Zoo, a park for ani¬ 
mals, is a shortened form of zoological gardens, and is, of course, 
pronounced in one syllable. 

The zodiac (ZO'-dee-ak) is a diagram, used in astrology, of the 
paths of the sun, moon, and planets; it contains, in part, Latin 
names for various animals— scorpio, scorpion; leo, lion; cancer, 
crab; taurus, bull; aries, ram; and pisces, fish. Hence its derivation 
from zoion, animal. 

The adjective is zodiacal (zo-Dl'-a-kal).

big reasons for the revolution of 1776 was that America wanted

You know the instrument that beginners at the piano use to 
guide their timing? A pendulum swings back and forth, making an 
audible click at each swing, and in that way governs or orders the 
measure (or timing) of the player. Hence it is called a metronome 
(MET'-ra-nom'), a word that combines nomos with metron , 
measurement. 


2. the earth and its life 

Geologist derives from Greek ge (geo-), earth. The science 
is geology (jee-OL'-a-jee). Can you write the adjective? 
___(Can you pronounce it?) 

Geometry (jee-OM'-a-tree)—ge plus metron —by etymology 
“measurement of the earth,” is that branch of mathematics treat¬ 
ing of the measurement and properties of solid and plane figures, 
such as angles, triangles, squares, spheres, prisms, etc. (The ety¬ 
mology of the word shows that this ancient science was originally 
concerned with the measurement- of land and spaces on the 
earth.) 

The mathematician is a geometrician (jee'-a-ma-TRISH'-an), 
the adjective is geometric (jee'-a-MET'-rik). 

Geography (jee-OG'-ra-fee) is writing about ( graphein, to 
write), or mapping, the earth. A practitioner of the science is a ge¬ 
ographer (jee-OG'-ra-far), the adjective is geographic (jee-a- 
GRAF'-ik)! 

(The name George is also derived from ge (geo-) , earth, plus 
ergon, work—the first George was an earth-worker or farmer.) 

Biologist combines bios, life, with logos, science, study. The sci¬ 
ence is biology (bl-OL'-a-jee). The adjective?_ 


Bios, life, is also found in biography (bl-OG'-ra-fee), writing 
about someone’s life; autobiography (aw'-ta-bl-OG'-ra-fee), the 
story of one’s life written by oneself; and biopsy (Bl'-op-see), a 
medical examination, or view ( opsis, optikos, view, vision), gen¬ 
erally through a microscope, of living tissue, frequently performed 
when cancer is suspected. A small part of the tissue is cut from 
the affected area and under the microscope its cells can be investi-

ment of stars and other celestial bodies. The science is astronomy 
(a-STRON'-o-mee), the adjective is astronomical (as'-tra- 
NOM'-a-kal), a word often used in a non-heavenly sense, as in 
“the astronomical size of the national debt.” Astronomy deals in 
such enormous distances (the sun, for example, is 93,000,000 
miles from the earth, and light from stars travels toward the earth 
at 186,000 miles per second) that the adjective astronomical is 
applied to any tremendously large figure. 

Astron , star, combines with logos to form astrology (a-STROL'- 
a-jee), which assesses the influence of planets and stars on human 
events. The practitioner is an astrologer (a-STROL'-a-jar). Can 

you form the adjective?_(Can 

you pronounce it?) 

By etymology, an astronaut (AS'-tra-not') is a sailor among 
the stars (Greek nautes, sailor). This person is termed with some¬ 
what less exaggeration a cosmonaut (KOZ'-ma-not')by the Rus¬ 
sians (Greek, kosmos, universe). Nautical (NOT'-a-kal), relating 
to sailors, sailing, ships, or navigation, derives also from nautes , 
and nautes in turn is from Greek naus, ship—a root used in nau¬ 
sea (etymologically, ship-sickness or seasickness!). 

Aster (AS'-tar) is a star shaped flower. Asterisk (AS'-ta-risk), 
a star-shaped symbol (*), is generally used in writing or printing 
to direct the reader to look for a footnote. Astrophysics (as'-tra- 
FTZ'-iks) is that branch of physics dealing with heavenly bodies. 

Disaster (da-ZAS'-tar) and disastrous (da-ZAS'-tras) also 
come from astron , star. In ancient times it was believed that the 
stars ruled human destiny; any misfortune or calamity, therefore, 
happened to someone because the stars were in opposition. ( Dis -, 
a prefix of many meanings, in this word signifies against .) 

Nomos, arrangement, law, or order, is found in two other in¬ 
teresting English words. 

For example, if you can make your own laws for yourself, if 
you needn’t answer to anyone else for what you do, in short, if 
you are independent, then you enjoy autonomy (aw-TON'-o- 
mee), a word that combines nomos , law, with autos, self. Au¬ 
tonomy, then, is self-law, self-government. The fifty states in our 
nation are fairly autonomous (aw-TON'-a-mas), but not com¬ 
pletely so. On the other hand, in most colleges each separate de¬ 
partment is pretty much autonomous. And of course, one of the

Chinese, Hebrew, Icelandic, Slavic, Teutonic, and every other 
kind spoken now or in the past by human beings, not excluding 
that delightful hodgepodge known as “pidgin English,” in which a 
piano is described as “big box, you hit ’um in teeth, he cry,” and

10. who are your friends and neighbors?

The field is all living organisms—from the simplest one-celled

a human being. Plant or animal, flesh or vegetable, denizen of 
water, earth, or air—if it lives and grows, this scientist wants to 
know more about it.

Animals of every description, kind, and condition, from birds to 
bees, fish to fowl, reptiles to humans, are the special area of ex¬ 
ploration of this scientist.

SESSION 11 


A true scientist lives up to the etymological meaning of his title 
“one who knows.” Anything scientific is based on facts—observ¬ 
able facts that can be recorded, tested, checked, and verified. 

Science, then, deals with human knowledge—as far as it has 
gone. It has gone very far indeed since the last century or two, 
when we stopped basing our thinking on guesses, wishes, theories 
that had no foundation in reality, and concepts of how the world 
ought to be; and instead began to explore the world as it was, and 
not only the world but the whole universe. From Galileo, who 
looked through the first telescope atop a tower in Pisa, Italy, 
through Pasteur, who watched microbes through a microscope, to 
Einstein, who deciphered riddles of the universe by means of 
mathematics, we have at last begun to fill in a few areas of igno¬ 
rance. 

Who are some of the more important explorers of knowl¬ 
edge—and by what terms are they known?

To bring this report up to the minute, I asked a number of edi¬ 
tors about their attitude toward the split infinitive. Here are two 
typical reactions. 

An editor at Doubleday and Company: “The restriction against 
the split infinitive is, to my mind, the most artificial of all gram¬ 
matical rules. I find that most educated people split infinitives reg¬ 
ularly in their speech, and only eliminate them from their writing 
when they rewrite and polish their material.” 

An editor at Reader’s Digest: “I want to defend the split infini¬ 
tive. The construction adds to the strength of the sentence—it’s 
compact and clear. This is to loudly say that I split an infinitive 
whenever I can catch one.” 

And here, finally, is the opinion of humorist James Thurber, as 
quoted by Rudolf Flesch in The Art of Plain Talk: “Word has 
somehow got around that the split infinitive is always wrong. This 
is of a piece with the outworn notion that it is always wrong to 
strike a lady.” 

I think the evidence is conclusive enough—it is perfectly correct 
to consciously split an infinitive whenever such an act increases 
the strength or clarity of your sentence. 



may only prescribe and fit glasses. And they are not medical doc¬ 
tors. The M.D. who specializes in the treatment of eye diseases, 
and who may operate when necessary, is an ophthalmologist. (See 
Chapter 4.) 

7. Do you prophecy another world war? 

wrong. Use prophecy only when you mean prediction, a noun. 
When you mean predict, a verb, as in this sentence, use prophesy. 
This distinction is simple and foolproof. Therefore we properly 
say: “His prophecy (prediction ) turned out to be true,” but “He 
really seems able to prophesy (predict ) political trends.” There is 
a distinction also in the pronunciation of these two words. Proph¬ 
ecy is pronounced PROF'-a-see; prophesy is pronunced PROF'- 
a-s I'. 


8. Leave us not mention it. 

wrong. On the less sophisticated levels of American speech, 
leave is a popular substitute for let. On educated levels, the fol¬ 
lowing distinction is carefully observed: let means allow; leave 
means depart. (There are a few idiomatic exceptions to this rule, 
but they present no problem.) “Let me go” is preferable to “Leave 
me go” even on the most informal of occasions, and a sentence 
like “Leave us not mention it” is not considered standard English. 

9. If you expect to eventually succeed, you must keep trying. 

right. We have here, in case you’re puzzled, an example of 

that notorious bugbear of academic grammar, the “split infinitive.” 
(An infinitive is a verb preceded by to: to succeed, to fail, to 
remember.) 

Splitting an infinitive is not at all difficult—you need only insert 
a word between the to and the verb: to eventually succeed, to 
completely fail, to quickly remember. 

Now that you know how to split an infinitive, the important 
question is, is it legal to do so? I am happy to be able to report to 
you that it is not only legal, it is also ethical, moral, and some¬ 
times more effective than to not split it. Benjamin Franklin, Wash¬ 
ington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Theodore Roosevelt, and 
Woodrow Wilson, among many others, were unconscionable 
infinitive splitters. And modem writers are equally partial to the 
construction.

yourself in the position of being damned if you do and damned if 
you don’t. 

3. Five and five is ten. 

right. But don’t jump to the conclusion that “five and five are 
ten” is wrong—both verbs are equally acceptable in this or any 
similar construction. If you prefer to think of “five-and-five” as a 
single mathematical concept, say is. If you find it more reasonable 
to consider “five and five” a plural idea, say are . The teachers I’ve 
polled on this point are about evenly divided in preference, and 
so, I imagine, are the rest of us. Use whichever verb has the 
greater appeal to your sense of logic. 

4. I never saw a man get so mad. 

right. When I questioned a number of authors and editors 
about their opinion of the acceptability of mad as a synonym for 
angry, the typical reaction was: “Yes, I say mad, but I always feel 
a little guilty when I do.” 

Most people do say mad when they are sure there is no English 
teacher listening; it’s a good sharp word, everybody understands 
exactly what it means, and it’s a lot stronger than angry, though 
not quite as violent as furious or enraged. In short, mad has a spe¬ 
cial implication offered by no other word in the English language; 
as a consequence, educated people use it as the occasion demands 
and it is perfectly correct. So correct, in fact, that every authori¬ 
tative dictionary lists it as a completely acceptable usage. If you 
feel guilty when you say mad, even though you don’t mean insane, 
it’s time you stopped plaguing your conscience with trivialities. 

5. Every one of his sisters are unmarried. 

wrong. Are is perhaps the more logical word, since the sen¬ 
tence implies that he has more than one sister and they are all un¬ 
married. In educated speech, however, the tendency is to make 
the verb agree with the subject, even if logic is violated in the 
process—and the better choice here would be is, agreeing with the 
singular subject, every one. 

6. He visited an optometrist for an eye operation. 

wrong. If the gentleman in question did indeed need an opera¬ 
tion, he went to the wrong doctor. In most states, optometrists are 
forbidden by law to perform surgery or administer drugs—they 



“Me, please!” 

“No, dear, not me” 

“Oh. 7, please?” 

(This sounds terrible to a child’s ear. It completely violates his 
sense of language, but he does want the jelly apple, so he grudg¬ 
ingly conforms.) 

“Who broke my best vase?” 

“It wasn’t me!” 

“Is that good English, Johnnie?” 

“Okay, it wasn’t I. But honest, Mom, it wasn’t me—I didn’t 
even touch it!” 

And so, if the child is strong enough to survive such constant 
corrections, he decides that whenever there is room for doubt, it is 
safer to say 7. 

Some adults, conditioned in childhood by the kind of misguided 
censorship detailed here, are likely to believe that “between you 
and 1” is the more elegant form of expression, but most educated 
speakers, obeying the rule that a preposition governs the objective 
pronoun, say “betweenyou and me” 

2. I’m your best friend, ain’t I? 

wrong. As linguistic scholars have frequently pointed out, it is 
unfortunate that ain’t I? is unpopular in educated speech, for the 
phrase fills a long-felt need. Am I not? is too prissy for down-to- 
earth people; amn't I? is ridiculous; and aren't 7, though popular 
in England, has never really caught on in America. With a sen¬ 
tence like the one under discussion you are practically in a linguis¬ 
tic trap—there is no way out unless you are willing to choose be¬ 
tween appearing illiterate, sounding prissy, or feeling ridiculous. 

“What is the matter with ain't I? for am I not?” language 
scholar Wallace Rice once wrote. “Nothing whatever, save that a 
number of minor grammarians object to it. Ain't I? has a pleasant 
sound once the ears are unstopped of prejudice.” Mr. Rice has a 
valid point there, yet educated people avoid ain't I? as if it were 
catching. In all honesty, therefore, I must say to you: don’t use 
ain't 1?, except humorously. What is a safe substitute? Apparently 
none exists, so I suggest that you manage, by some linguistic calis¬ 
thenics, to avoid having to make a choice. Otherwise you may find

expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention 
to the italicized word or words. Does the usage square with your 
own language patterns? Would you be willing to phrase your

or wrong, then compare your conclusion with the opinions given

“Who wants a jelly apple?”

“Then use the proper word.” 

(The child becomes a little confused at this point-—there seem 
to be so many “proper” and “improper” words.)

-Brief Intermission Three- 


HOW GRAMMAR CHANGES 


If you think that grammar is an exact science, get ready for a 
shock. Grammar is a science, all right—but it is most inexact. 
There are no inflexible laws, no absolutely hard and fast rules, no 
unchanging principles. Correctness varies with the times and 
depends much more on geography, on social class, and on collec¬ 
tive human caprice than on the restrictions found in textbooks. 

In mathematics, which is an exact science, five and five make 
ten the country over—in the North, in the South, in the West; in 
Los Angeles and Coral Gables and New York. There are no two 
opinions on the matter—we are dealing, so far as we know, with a 
universal and indisputable fact. 

In grammar, however, since the facts are highly susceptible to 
change, we have to keep an eye peeled for trends. What are 
educated people saying these days? Which expressions are gener¬ 
ally used and accepted on educated levels, which others are more 
or less restricted to the less educated levels of speech? The an¬ 
swers to these questions indicate the trend of usage in the United 
States, and if such trends come in conflict with academic rules, 
then the rules are no longer of any great importance. 

Grammar follows the speech habits of the majority of educated 
people—not the other way around . That is the important point to 
keep in mind. 

The following notes on current trends in modern usage are in- 

109 



suddenly and inexplicably become popular among writers? Obvi¬ 
ously, that’s nonsense. 

The change is in you. You have now begun to be alert to words, 
you have developed what is known in psychology as a “mind-set” 
toward certain words. Therefore, whenever these words occur in 
your reading you take special notice of them. 

The same words occurred before—and just as plentifully—but 
since they presented little communication to you, you reacted to 
them with an unseeing eye, with an ungrasping mind. You were 
figuratively, and almost literally, blind to them. 

Do you remember when you bought, or contemplated buying, a 
new car? Let’s say it was a Toyota. Suddenly you began to see 
Toyotas all around you—you had a Toyota “mind-set” 

It is thus with anything new in your life. Development of a 
“mind-set” means that the new experience has become very real, 
very important, almost vital. 

If you have become suddenly alert to the new words you have 
been learning, you’re well along toward your goal of building a 
superior vocabulary. You are beginning to live in a new and dif¬ 
ferent intellectual atmosphere—nothing less! 

On the other hand, if the phenomenon I have been describing 
has not yet occurred, do not despair. It will. I am alerting you to 
its possibilities—recognize it and welcome it when it happens.

BECOMING WORD-CONSCIOUS 

Perhaps, if you have been working as assiduously with this 
book as I have repeatedly counseled, you have noticed an interest¬ 
ing phenomenon. 

This phenomenon is as follows: You read a magazine article 
and suddenly you see one or more of the words you have recently 
learned. Or you open a book and there again are some of the 
words you have been working with. In short, all your reading 
seems to call to your attention the very words you’ve been study¬ 
ing.

The Latin word for old is senex, the base on which senile, 
senescent, senior, and senate are built. 

1. senile (SEE-nil)—showing signs of the physical and/or 
mental deterioration that generally marks very old age. The noun 
is senility (so-NIL'-o-tee). 

2. senescent (so-NES'-ant)—aging, growing old. (Note the 
same suffix in this word as in adolescent, growing into an adult, 
convalescent, growing healthy again, and obsolescent, growing or 
becoming obsolete.) The noun is senescence (sa-NES'-sns).

ENGLISH WORD 


102 



Though chirography may be a lost art, calligraphy (ka-LIG'-ra- 
fee) is enjoying a revival. For centuries before the advent of print¬ 
ing, calligraphy, or penmanship as an artistic expression, was 
practiced by monks. 

A calligrapher (ks-LIG'-ra-fsr) is called upon to design and 
write announcements, place cards, etc., as a touch of elegance. 
The adjective is calligraphic (kal'-a-GRAF'-ik). 

Calligraphy combines graphein with Greek kallos,i beauty, and 
so, by etymology, means beautiful writing. 

If a word exists for artistic handwriting, there must be one for 
the opposite—bad, scrawly, or illegible handwriting. And indeed 
there is— cacography (ka-KOG'-ra-fee), combining graphein 
with Greek kakos, bad, harsh. 

By analogy with the forms of calligraphy, can you write the 
word for: 

One who uses bad or illegible handwriting? 


Pertaining to, or marked by, bad handwriting ( adjective )? 


Graphein is found in other English words: 

1. cardiograph (discussed in Chapter 4)—etymologically a 
“heart writer” ( kardia, heart). 

2. photograph —etymologically, “written by light” (Greek 
photos, light). 

3. phonograph —etymologically, a “sound writer” (Greek 
phone, sound). 

4. telegraph —etymologically a “distance writer” (Greek tele-, 
distance). 

5. biography —etymologically “life writing” (Greek, bios, life). 
(Many of these new roots will be discussed in greater detail in 

later chapters.) 


2. aging and the old 

We know that a geriatrician specializes in the medical care of 
the elderly. The Greek word geras, old age, has a derived form, 

t An entrancing word that also derives from kail os is callipygian (kal'-o 
PIJ'-ee-an), an adjective describing a shapely or attractive rear end, or a 
person so endowed—the combining root is pyge, buttocks. 


101 





5. an early start 

You have such a long history of persistent falsification that one 
can only suspect that your vice started when you were reposing in 
your mother’s womb. In other words, and allowing for a great 
deal of exaggeration for effect, you have been lying from the mo¬ 
ment of your birth. 

A congenital liar 


6. no letup 

You never stop lying. While normal people lie on occasion, and 
often for special reasons, you lie continually—not occasionally or 
even frequently, but over and over. 

A chronic liar 


7. a strange disease 

You are not concerned with the difference between truth and 
falsehood; you do not bother to distinguish fact from fantasy. In 
fact, your lying is a disease that no antibiotic can cure. 

A pathological liar 


8. no regrets 

You are completely without a conscience. No matter what 
misery your fabrications may cause your innocent victims, you 
never feel the slightest twinge of guilt. Totally unscrupulous, you 
are a dangerous person to get mixed up with. 

An unconscionable liar 


9. smooth! 

Possessed of a lively imagination and a ready tongue, you can 
distort facts as smoothly and as effortlessly as you can say your 
name. But you do not always get away with your lies. 


151 



Ironically enough, it is your very smoothness that makes you 
suspect: your answers are too quick to be true. Even if we can’t 
immediately catch you in your lies, we have learned from unhappy 
past experience not to suspend our critical faculties when you are 
talking. We admire your nimble wit, but we listen with a skeptical 
ear. 


A glib liar 


10. outstanding! 

Lies, after all, are bad—they are frequently injurious to other 
people, and may have a particularly dangerous effect on you as a 
liar. At best, if you are caught you suffer some embarrassment. At 
worst, if you succeed in your deception your character becomes 
warped and your sense of values suffers. Almost all lies are harm¬ 
ful; some are no less than vicious. 

If you are one type of liar, all your lies are vicious—calcu- 
latedly, predeterminedly, coldly, and advisedly vicious. In short, 
your lies are so outstandingly hurtful that people gasp in amaze¬ 
ment and disgust at hearing them. 

An egregious liar 


In this chapter the ten basic words revolve rather closely around 
a central core. Each one, however, has a distinct, a unique mean¬ 
ing, a special implication. Note the differences. 


TYPE OF LIAR 

1. notorious 

2. consummate 

3. incorrigible 

4. inveterate 

5. congenital 


SPECIAL IMPLICATION 
famous —or infamous —for lying; 
tendency to falsify is well-known 
great skill 

too far gone to be reformed — 
impervious to rehabilitation 
lying has become a deep-rooted habit 
lying had very early beginnings —as if 
from birth 


152 



6. chronic 

7. pathological 

8. unconscionable 

9. glib 

10. egregious 


over and over 

an irresistible compulsion to lie—often 
for no rational reason; lying is a disease 
lack of regret or remorse 
great smoothness 
viciousness of the lies 


These ten expressive 
stricted to lying or liars. 

1. notorious 

2. consummate 

3. incorrigible 

4. inveterate 

5. congenital 

6. chronic 

7. pathological 

8. unconscionable 

9. glib 

10. egregious 


adjectives, needless to say, are not re- 
Note their general meanings: 

well-known for some bad quality—a 

notorious philanderer 

perfect, highly skilled —consummate 

artistry at the keyboard 

beyond reform—an incorrigible 

optimist 

long-accustomed, deeply habituated— 
an inveterate smoker (this adjective, 
like notorious, usually has an unfavor¬ 
able connotation) 
happening at or during birth-a 
congenital deformity 
going on for a long time, or occurring 
again and again —chronic appendicitis 
diseased—a pathological condition 
without pangs of conscience-uncon¬ 
scionable cruelty to children 
smooth, suspiciously fluent-a glib 
witness 

outstandingly bad or vicious-an 
egregious error 


With the exception of consummate and congenital, all ten ad¬ 
jectives have strongly derogatory implications and are generally 
used to describe people, characteristics, or conditions we disap¬ 
prove of.

SESSION 15 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1. well-known 

“Widely but unfavorably known” is the common definition for 
notorious . Just as a notorious liar is well-known for unreliable 
statements, so a notorious gambler, a notorious thief, or a notori - 


157 



ous killer has achieved a wide reputation for some form of an¬ 
tisocial behavior. The noun is notoriety (no-te-RI'-o-tee). 

The derivation is from Latin notus, known, from which we also 
get noted. It is an interesting characteristic of some words that a 
change of syllables can alter the emotional impact. Thus, an ad¬ 
mirer of certain business executives will speak of them as “noted 
industrialists”; these same people’s enemies will call them “ notori¬ 
ous exploiters.” Similarly, if we admire a man’s or a woman’s un¬ 
worldliness, we refer to it by the complimentary term childlike; 
but if we are annoyed by the trait, we describe it, derogatively, as 
childish. Change “-like” to “-ish” and our emotional tone under¬ 
goes a complete reversal. 


2. plenty of room at the top 

The top of a mountain is called, as you know, the summit , a 
word derived from Latin summus, highest, which also gives us 
the mathematical term sum, as in addition. A consummate artist 
has reached the very highest point of perfection; and to consum¬ 
mate (KON'-sa-mayt') a marriage, a business deal, or a contract 
is, etymologically, to bring it to the highest point; that is, to put 
the final touches to it, to bring it to completion. 

[Note how differently consummate (kon-SUM'-ot), the adjec¬ 
tive, is pronounced from the verb to consummate (KON'-sa- 

mayt')]. 

Nouns are formed from adjectives by the addition of the noun 
suffix -ness: sweet — sweetness; simple — simpleness; envious — en¬ 
viousness; etc. 

Many adjectives, however, have alternate noun forms, and the 
adjective consummate is one of them. To make a noun out of con¬ 
summate, add either - ness or -acy; consummateness (kon-SUM'- 
ot-nos) or consummacy (kon-SUM'-o-see). 

Verbs ending in - ate invariably tack on the noun suffix -ion to 
form nouns: create — creation; evaluate — evaluation; etc. 

Can you write the noun form of the verb to consummate?

3. no help 

Call people incorrigible (in-KAWR'-a-ja-bal) if they do any¬ 
thing to excess, and if all efforts to correct or reform them are to 
no avail. Thus, one can be an incorrigible idealist, an incorrigible 
criminal, an incorrigible optimist, or an incorrigible philanderer. 
The word derives from Latin corrigo, to correct or set straight, 
plus the negative prefix in-. (This prefix, depending on the root it 
precedes, may be negative, may intensify the root, as in invaluable, 
or may mean in.) 

The noun is incorrigibility (in-kawr'-s-p-BIL'-s-tee) or, alter¬ 
natively, incorrigibleness . 


4. veterans 

Inveterate, from Latin vetus, old,* generally indicates disap¬ 
proval. 

Inveterate gamblers have grown old in the habit, etymologically 
speaking; inveterate drinkers have been imbibing for so long that 
they, too, have formed old, well-established habits; and inveterate 
liars have been lying for so long, and their habits are by now so 
deep-rooted, that one can scarcely remember (the word implies) 
when they ever told the truth. 

The noun is inveteracy (in-VET'-or-s-see) or inveterateness. 

A veteran (VET'-a-ran), as of the Armed Forces, grew older 
serving the country; otherwise a veteran is an old hand at the 
game (and therefore skillful). The word is both a noun and an 
adjective: a veteran at (or in) swimming, tennis, police work, 
business, negotiations, diplomacy—or a veteran actor, teacher, 
diplomat, political reformer. 

* Latin senex , source of senile and senescent , also, you will recaU, means 
old. In inveterate, in - means in; it is not the negative prefix found in incor¬ 
rigible. 


159 



5. birth 

Greek genesis, birth or origin, a root we discovered in discuss¬ 
ing psychogenic (Chapter 5), is the source of a great many Eng¬ 
lish words. 

Genetics (ja-NET'-iks) is the science that treats of the trans¬ 
mission of hereditary characteristics from parents to offspring. 
The scientist specializing in the field is a geneticist (ja-NET'-a- 
sist), the adjective is genetic (ja-NET'-ik). The particle in the 
chromosome of the germ cell containing a hereditary charac¬ 
teristic is a gene (JEEN). 

Genealogy (jeen'-ee-AL'-a-jee) is the study of family trees or 
ancestral origins (logos, study). The practitioner is a genealogist 
(jeen'-ee-AL'-a-jist). Can you form the adjective? 
-——-(And can you pronounce it?) 

The genital (GEN'-a-tal), or sexual, organs are involved in the 
process of conception and birth. The genesis (JEN'-a-sis) of any¬ 
thing—a plan, idea, thought, career, etc.—is its beginning, birth, 
or origin, and Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament, 
describes the creation, or birth, of the universe. 

Congenital is constructed by combining the prefix con-, with or 
together, and the root genesis, birth. 

So a congenital defect, deformity, condition, etc. occurs during 
the nine-month birth process (or period of gestation, to become 
technical). Hereditary (ha-RED'-a-tair'-ee) characteristics, on 
the other hand, are acquired at the moment of conception. Thus, 
eye color, nose shape, hair texture, and other such qualities are 
hereditary; they are determined by the genes in the germ cells of 
the mother and father. But a thalidomide baby resulted from the 
use of the drug by a pregnant woman, so the deformities were 
congenital . 

Congenital is used both literally and figuratively. Literally, the 
word generally refers to some medical deformity or abnormality 
occurring during gestation. Figuratively, it wildly exaggerates, for 
effect, the very early existence of some quality: congenital liar, 
congenital fear of the dark, etc.

SESSION 16 

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. of time and place 

A chronic liar lies constantly, again and again and again; a 
chronic invalid is ill time after time, frequently, repeatedly. The 
derivation of the word is Greek chronos, time. The noun form is 
chronicity (kra-NIS'-a-tee). 

An anachronism (a-NAK'-ra-niz-am) is someone or something 
out of time, out of date, belonging to a different era, either earlier 


164 



or later. (The prefix ana- like a-, is negative.) The adjective is 
anachronous (a-NAK'-ra-nas) or anachronistic (a-nak'-ra-NIS'- 
tik). 

Wander along Fifty-ninth Street and Central Park in Manhattan 
some Sunday. You will see horse-drawn carriages with top-hatted 
coachmen—a vestige of the 1800s. Surrounded by twentieth-cen¬ 
tury motorcars and modern skyscrapers, these romantic vehicles 
of a bygone era are anachronous . 

Read a novel in which a scene is supposedly taking place in the 
nineteenth century and see one of the characters turning on a TV 
set. An anachronism! 

Your friend talks, thinks, dresses, and acts as if he were living 
in the time of Shakespeare. Another anachronism / 

Science fiction is deliberately anachronous —it deals with phe¬ 
nomena, gadgetry, accomplishments far off (possibly) in the fu¬ 
ture. 

An anachronism is out of time; something out of place is incon¬ 
gruous (in-KONG'-grtfo-as), a word combining the negative 
prefix in-, the prefix con-, with or together, and a Latin verb 
meaning to agree or correspond . 

Thus, it is incongruous to wear a sweater and slacks to a formal 
wedding; it is anachronous to wear the wasp waist, conspicuous 
bustle, or powdered wig of the eighteenth century. The noun form 
of incongruous is incongruity (in-kang-GROO'^a-tee). 

Chronological (kron-a-LOJ'-a-kal), in correct time order, 
comes from chronos. To tell a story chronologically is to relate the 
events in the time order of their occurrence. Chronology (kra- 
NOL'-a-jee) is the science of time order and the accurate dating 
of events (logos, science)— 7 the expert in this field is a chronol- 
ogist (kra-NOL'-a-jist)—or a list of events in the time order in 
which they have occurred or will occur. 

A chronometer (kra-NOM'-a-tar), combining chronos with met- 
ron, measurement, is a highly accurate timepiece, especially one 
used on ships. Chronometry (kra-NOM'-a-tree) is the measure¬ 
ment of time—the adjective is chronometric (kron'-a-MET'-rik). 

Add the prefix syn-, together, plus the verb suffix -ize, to 
chronos, and you have constructed synchronize (SIN'-kra-nTz'), 
etymologically to time together, or to move, happen, or cause to 
happen, at the same time or rate. If you and your friend synchro- 


165 



nize your watches, you set them at the same time. If you synchro¬ 
nize the activity of your arms and legs, as in swimming, you move 
them at the same time or rate. The adjective is synchronous 
(SIN'-kra-nas); the noun form of the verb synchronize is syn¬ 
chronization ( sin'-kra-na-ZA Y'-shan ). 


2. disease, suffering, feeling 

Pathological is diseased (a pathological condition)—this mean¬ 
ing of the word ignores the root logos, science, study. 

Pathology (pa-THOL'-a-jee) is the science or study of disease 
—its nature, cause, cure, etc. However, another meaning of the 
noun ignores logos, and pathology may be any morbid, diseased, 
or abnormal physical condition or conditions; in short, simply dis¬ 
ease, as in “This case involves so many kinds of pathology that 
several different specialists are working on it.” 

A pathologist (pa-THOL'-a-jist) is an expert who examines tis¬ 
sue, often by autopsy or biopsy, to diagnose disease and interpret 
the abnormalities in such tissue that may be caused by specific dis¬ 
eases. 

Pathos occurs in some English words with the additional mean¬ 
ing of feeling. If you feel or suffer with someone, you are sympa¬ 
thetic (sim-pa-THET'-ik)— sym- is a respelling before the letter p 
of the Greek prefix syn-, with or together. The noun is sympathy 
(SIM'-pa-thee), the verb sympathize (SIM'-pa-thlz). Husbands, 
for example, so the story goes, may have sympathetic labor pains 
when their wives are about to deliver. 

The prefix anti-, you will recall, means against. If you experi¬ 
ence antipathy (an-TIP'-a-thee) to people or things, you feel 
against them—you feel strong dislike or hostility. The adjective is 
antipathetic (an'-ta-pa-THET'-ik), as in “an antipathetic reac¬ 
tion to an authority figure.” 

But you may have no feeling at all—just indifference, lack of 
any interest, emotion, or response, complete listlessness, especially 
when some reaction is normal or expected. Then you are apathetic 
(ap-a-THET'-ik); a-, as you know, is a negative prefix. The noun 
is apathy (AP'-a-thee), as in voter apathy, student apathy, etc. 


166 



On the other hand, you may be so sensitive or perceptive that 
you not only share the feelings of another, but you also identify 
with those feelings, in fact experience them yourself as if momen¬ 
tarily you were that other person. What you have, then, is em¬ 
pathy (EM'-pa-thee); you empathize (EM'-po-thlz'), you are 
empathetic (em-pa-THET'-ik), or, to use an alternate adjective, 
empathic (em-PATH'-ik). Em- is a respelling before the letter p 
of the Greek prefix en-, in. 

Someone is pathetic (pa-THET'-ik) who is obviously suffering 
—such a person may arouse sympathy or pity (or perhaps an¬ 
tipathy?) in you. A pathetic story is about suffering and, again, is 
likely to arouse sadness, sorrow, or pity. 

Some interesting research was done many years ago by Dr. J. B. 
Rhine and his associates at Duke University on extrasensory per¬ 
ception; you will find an interesting account of Rhine’s work in his 
book The Reach of the Mind . What makes it possible for two peo¬ 
ple separated by miles of space to communicate with each other 
without recourse to messenger, telephone, telegraph, or postal 
service? It can be done, say the believers in telepathy (ta-LEP'-a- 
thee), also called mental telepathy, though they do not yet admit 
to knowing how. How can one person read the mind of another? 
Simple—by being telepathic (tel-a-PATH'-ik), but no one can 
explain the chemistry or biology of it. Telepathy is built by com¬ 
bining pathos, feeling, with the prefix tele-, distance, the same 
prefix we found in telephone, telegraph, telescope . 

Telepathic (tel-a-PATH'-ik) communication occurs when peo¬ 
ple can feel each other’s thoughts from a distance, when they have 
ESP.

SESSION 17 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. knowing - 

Psychopaths commit antisocial and unconscionable acts—they 
are not troubled by conscience , guilt, remorse, etc. over what they 
have done. 

Unconscionable and conscience are related in derivation—the 
first word from Latin scio, to know, the second from Latin sciens, 
knowing, and bothusing the prefix con with, together. 

Etymologically, then, your conscience is your knowledge with a 
moral sense of right and wrong; if you are unconscionable, your 
conscience is not {un-) working, or you have no conscience. The 


172 




noun form is unconscionableness or unconscionability (un-kon'- 
sha-no-BIL'-o-tee). 

Conscious, also from con - plus scio, is knowledge or awareness 
of one’s emotions or sensations, or of what’s happening around 
one. 

Science , from sciens, is systematized knowledge as opposed, for 
example, to belief, faith, intuition, or guesswork. 

Add Latin omnis, all, to sciens, to construct omniscient (om- 
NISH'-ont), all-knowing, possessed of infinite knowledge. The 
noun is omniscience (om-NISH'-ons). 

Add the prefix pre before, to sciens , to construct prescient 
(PREE'-shont)—knowing about events before they occur, i.e., 
psychic, or possessed of unusual powers of prediction. The noun 
is prescience (PREE'-shons). 

And, finally, add the negative prefix ne- to sciens to produce 
nescient (NESH'-ont), not knowing, or ignorant. Can you, by 
analogy with the previous two words, write the noun form of nes¬ 
cient? _(Can you pronounce it?) 


2. fool some of the people . . . 

Glib is from an old English root that means slippery. Glib liars 
or glib talkers are smooth and slippery; they have ready answers, 
fluent tongues, a persuasive air—but, such is the implication of 
the word, they fool only the most nescient , for their smoothness 
lacks sincerity and conviction. 

The noun is glibness . 


3. herds and flocks 

Egregious (remember the pronunciation? o-GREE'-jss) is from 
Latin grex, gregis , herd or flock. An egregious lie, act, crime, mis¬ 
take, etc. is so exceptionally vicious that it conspicuously stands 
out (e-, a shortened form of the prefix ex-, out) from the herd or 
flock of other bad things. 

The noun is egregiousness (o-GREE'-jos-nss). 

A person who enjoys companionship, who, etymologically, likes 
to be with the herd, who reaches out for friends and is happiest 


173 



when surrounded by people—such a person is gregarious (gra- 
GAIR'-ee-ss). 

Extroverts are of course gregarious —they prefer human con¬ 
tact, conversation, laughter, interrelationships, to solitude. 

The suffix - ness, as you know, can be added to an adjective to 
construct a noun form. Write the noun for gregarious: 


Add the prefix con-, with, together, to grex, gregis, to get the 
verb congregate (KONG'-gra-gayt'); add the prefix se-, apart, to 
build the verb segregate (SEG'-ro-gayt'); add the prefix ad-, to, 
toward {ad- changes to ag- before a root starting with g-) y to con¬ 
struct the verb aggregate (AG-ro-gayf). 

Let’s see what we have. When people gather together in a herd 

or flock , they (write the verb) --- 

The noun is congregation (cong'-gra-GAY'-shan), one of the 
meanings of which is a religious “flock.” 

Put people or things apart from the herd , and you (write the 

verb) _them. Can you construct 

the noun by adding the suitable noun suffix? 


Bring individual items to or toward the herd or flock , and you 

(write the verb) _them. What is 

the noun form of this verb?_ 

The verb aggregate also means to come together to or toward 
the herd , that is, to gather into a mass or whole, or by extension, 
to total or amount to . So aggregate , another noun form, pro¬ 
nounced AG'-ra-gat, is a group or mass of individuals considered 
as a whole, a herd, or a flock, as in the phrase “people in the 
aggregate . . .”

TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST 

1. “She was one of many notables who attended the conven¬ 
tion.” Recognizing that the italicized word is built on the root 
notus, can you define the noun notable in the context of known? 


2. Notify and notice derive from the same root. Can you define 
these two words, again in the context of known? Notify: 
-- Notice: __ 


179 





What do you supose the verb suffix -fy of notify means? (Think 

also of simplify, clarify, liquefy, etc.)-- 

3. You are familiar with the roots chronos and graphein. Sup¬ 
pose you came across the word chronograph in your reading. Can 
you make an educated guess as to the meaning?- 


4. Recognizing the root genesis in the verb generate, how 
would you define the word?- 


How about regenerate? 


What do you suppose the prefix re - means? 


5. Recognizing the root omnis in omnipotent and omnipresent, 
can you define the words? 

Omnipotent: _ 

Omnipresent: _ 

Recalling how we formed a noun from the adjective omniscient, 
write the noun forms of: 

Omnipotent:_ 

Omnipresent:_ 

6. Think of the negative prefix in anachronism; think next of 

the noun aphrodisiac . Can you construct a word for that which re¬ 
duces or eliminates sexual desire? _. 

(Answers in Chapter 18) 


FOUR LASTING BENEFITS 

You know by now that it is easy to build your vocabulary if you 
work diligently and intelligently. Diligence is important—to come 
to the book occasionally is to learn new words and ideas in an 


180 








aimless fashion, rather than in the continuous way that charac¬ 
terizes the natural, uninterrupted, intellectual growth of a child. 
(You will recall that children are top experts in increasing their 
vocabularies.) And an intelligent approach is crucial—new words 
can be completely understood and permanently remembered only 
as symbols of vital ideas, never if memorized in long lists of iso¬ 
lated forms. 

If you have worked diligently and intelligently, you have done 
much more than merely learned a few hundred new words. Actu¬ 
ally, I needn’t tell you what else you’ve accomplished, since, if you 
really have accomplished it, you can feel it for yourself; but it may 
be useful if I verbalize the feelings you may have. 

In addition to learning the meanings, pronunciation, back¬ 
ground, and use of 300-350 valuable words, you have: 

1. Begun to sense a change in your intellectual atmosphere. 
(You have begun to do your thinking with many of the words, 
with many of the ideas behind the words. You have begun to use 
the words in your speech and writing, and have become alert to 
their appearance in your reading.) 

2. Begun to develop a new interest in words as expressions of 
ideas. 

3. Begun to be aware of the new words you hear and that you 
see in your reading. 

4. Begun to gain a new feeling for the relationship between 
words. (For you realize that many words are built on roots from 
other languages and are related to other words which derive from 
the same roots.) 

Now, suppose we pause to see how successful your learning has 
been. 

In the next chapter, I offer you a comprehensive test on the first 
part of your work.

HOW TO CHECK YOUR PROGRESS 

Comprehensive Test l 


SESSION 18 


If you have worked diligently thus far, you have: 

1. Become acquainted, or perhaps reacquainted, with approxi¬ 
mately 300-350 expressive words— 

2. Learned scores of important Latin and Greek prefixes, roots, 
and suffixes— 

3. Set up valuable habits of self-discipline and self-directed 
learning— 

4. Explored your attitudes toward grammar and current usage, 
meanwhile erasing any confusion you may once have felt 
about specific problems of correctness in your use of 
words— 

5. And, finally, taken good, long steps toward your ultimate 
goal, namely, the development of a better, richer, more 
expressive—in short, superior —vocabulary. 

Here is your chance both to review and to check your learning.

SESSION 19 


Verbs are incalculably useful to you. 

Every sentence you think, say, read, or write contains an im¬ 
plied or expressed verb, for it is the verb that carries the action, 
the movement, the force of your ideas. 

As a young child, you used verbs fairly early. 

Your first words, of course, were probably nouns, as you iden¬ 
tified the things or people around you. 

Mama, Dada, doll, baby, bottle, etc. perhaps were the first 
standard syllables you uttered, for naming concrete things or real 
persons is the initial step in the development of language. 

Soon there came the ability to express intangible ideas, and then 
you began to use simple verbs— go, stop, stay, want, eat, sleep, 
etc. 

As you gained maturity, your verbs expressed ideas of greater 
and greater complexity; as an adult you can describe the most in¬ 
volved actions in a few simple syllables—if you have a good store 
of useful verbs at your command. 

The richer and more extensive your vocabulary of verbs, the 
more accurately and expressively you can communicate your un¬ 
derstanding of actions, reactions, attitudes, and emotions. 

Let’s be specific. 


IDEAS 


1. playing it down 

Ready to go back thirty or more years? Consider some post- 
World War II American political history: 

Harry Truman couldn’t win the 1948 election. The pollsters 
said so, the Republicans heartily agreed, even the Democrats, 


192 



some m high places, believed it. Mr. Truman himself was perhaps 
the only voter in the country who was not entirely convinced. 

Came the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November- 
well, if you were one of those who stayed up most of the night lis¬ 
tening to the returns, and then kept your ear to the radio most of 
the next day, you recall how you reacted to the unique Truman 
triumph. 

It was no mean accomplishment, thought many people. Pure ac¬ 
cident, said others. If one out of twelve voters in a few key states 
had changed his ballot, Harry could have gone back to selling ties, 
one Republican apologist pointed out It wasn’t anything Truman 
did, said another; it was what Dewey didn’t do. No credit to 
Truman, said a third; it was the farmers—or labor—or the Re¬ 
publicans who hadn’t bothered to vote—or the ingenious mis¬ 
counting of ballots. No credit to Truman, insisted a fourth; it was 
Wallace’s candidacy—it was the Democrats—it was Republican 
overconfidence—it was sunspots—it was the Communists—it was 
the civil service workers who didn’t want to lose their cushy jobs 
—it was really Roosevelt who won the election. 

Anyway Harry didn’t accomplish a thing—he was just a victim 
of good fortune. 

What were the apologists for Dewey’s failure doing? 

They were disparaging Truman’s achievement. 


2. playing it safe 

Willing to look at some more history of the late 1940s? 

Of course, Dewey did campaign, in his own way, for the presi¬ 
dency. As the Republican aspirant, he had to take a stand on the 
controversial Taft-Hartley Act. 

Was he for it? He was for that part of it which was good. Natu¬ 
rally, he was against any of the provisions which were bad. Was 
he for it? The answer was yes —and also no. Take whichever an¬ 
swer you wanted most to hear. 

What was Dewey doing? 

He was equivocating.

3. enjoying the little things 

Have you ever gone through a book that was so good you kept 
hugging yourself mentally as you read? Have you ever seen a play 
or motion picture that was so charming that you felt sheer delight 
as you watched? Or perhaps you have had a portion of pumpkin- 
chiffon pie, light and airy and mildly flavored, and with a flaky, 
delicious crust, that was the last word in gustatory enjoyment? 

Now notice the examples I have used. I have not spoken of 
books that grip you emotionally, of plays and movies that keep 
you on the edge of your seat in suspense, or of food that satisfies a 
ravenous hunger. These would offer quite a different, perhaps 
more lasting and memorable, type of enjoyment. I have detailed, 
rather, mental or physical stimuli that excite enjoyably but not too 
sharply—a delightful novel, a charming play, a delicious dessert. 

How do such things affect you? 

They titillate you. 


4. playing it way up 

You know how the teen-agers of an earlier generation adored, 
idolized, and overwhelmed Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, the Bea¬ 
tles? 

And of course you know how certain people fall all over visiting 
celebrities—best-selling authors, much publicized artists, or fa¬ 
mous entertainers. They show them ingratiating, almost servile at¬ 
tention, worship and flatter them fulsomely.* 

How do we say it in a single word? 

They adulate such celebrities. 


5. accentuating the negative 

What does the doctor say to you if you have low blood sugar? 
“No candy, no pastries, no chocolate marshmallow cookies, no ice 

* Fulsome (FOOL'-som) does not mean, despite its appearance, fully or 
completely, but rather, offensive because of excessiveness or insincerity, 
often in reference to compliments, praise, admiration, or flattery. 


194 



cream!”, your morale dropping lower and lower , as each favorite 
goody is placed on the forbidden list. 

What, in one word, is the doctor doing? 

The doctor is proscribing harmful 
items in your diet. 


6. accentuating the affirmative 

You are warm, friendly, enthusiastic, outgoing, easy to please; 
you are quick to show appreciation, yet accept, without judgment 
or criticism, the human weaknesses of others. 

You are a fascinating talker, an even better listener. 

You believe in, and practice, honest self-disclosure; you feel 
comfortable with yourself and therefore with everyone else; and 
you have a passionate interest in experiencing, in living, in relating 
to people. 

Need you have any fears about making friends? Obviously not. 

Your characteristics and temperament 
obviate such fears. 

7. playing it wrong 

Theodor Reik, in his penetrating book on psychoanalysis Lis¬ 
tening with the Third Ear , talks about neurotic people who uncon¬ 
sciously wish to fail. In business interviews they say exactly the 
wrong words, they do exactly the wrong things, they seem intent 
(as, unconsciously, they actually are) on insuring failure in every 
possible way, though consciously they are doing their best to court 
success. 

What effect does such a neurotic tendency have? 

It militates against success. 


8. playing it dirty 

“Harry?” He's a closet alcoholic. Maud? She's sleeping around 
—and her stupid husband doesn’t suspect a thing. Bill? He’s em¬ 
bezzling from his own company . Paul? He's a child molester. 


195 



S£lly? You don’t know that she’s a notorious husband-beater?” 
What is this character doing? 


He’s maligning everyone. 


9. giving the benefit of any doubt 

Do you think it’s all right to cheat on your income taxes? At 
least just a little? It’s wrong, of course, but doesn’t everybody do 
it? 

How do you feel about marital infidelity? Are you inclined to 
overlook the occasional philandering of the male partner, since, 
after all, to invent a cliche, men are essentially polygamous by na¬ 
ture? 

If your answers are in the affirmative, how are you reacting to 
such legal or ethical transgressions? 

You condone them. 


10. changing hostility 

Unwittingly you have done something that has aroused anger 
and resentment in your best friend. You had no desire to hurt 
him, yet he makes it obvious that he feels pretty bitter about the 
whole situation. (Perhaps you failed to invite him to a gathering 
he wanted to come to; or you neglected to consult him before 
making a decision on a matter in which he felt he should have 
some say.) His friendship is valuable to you and you wish to re¬ 
store yourself in his good graces. What do you do? 

You try to placate him.

In this exercise you gain the value of actually writing a new 
word as a meaningful solution to a problem. To think about a 
word, to say it, to write it, to use it—that is the road to word mas¬

1. You’ve been asked to take a stand on a certain issue, but you 
don’t have the courage to be either definitely for or against. 

you_:__ 

2. You spread around an unpleasant story that you know will 
blacken someone’s reputation. 

You_that person. 

3. Your Mend is justifiably angry—you asked him to go to a 
party with you, ignored him all evening, and then finally left 
with someone else. What must you do if you wish to restore 
the relationship? 

You must try to_him. 

4. You virtually worship your therapist. You express your admi¬ 
ration in lavish flattery; you praise her in such excessive terms 
that she appears devoid of all human frailty. 

You_her. 

5. You are crowding 260 on the scales, so your doctor warns 
against high-calorie meals, rich desserts, second helpings, ex¬ 
cessive carbohydrates, etc. 

The doctor_1_these foods.

6. Your child Johnnie has smacked the neighbor’s kid—entirely 
without provocation, you are forced to admit. But after all, 
you think, tomorrow the other kid will, with equal lack of 
provocation, probably smack Johnnie.

7. When your son, understandably expecting praise, mentions 
the three B’s and two A’s he earned in his courses, you re¬ 
spond, callously, “Is that the best you can do? What stopped 
you from getting all A’s?” 

You-his accomplishment.

a withdrawal; then unexpectedly you discover a twenty-dollar

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. equality 

If you play golf, you know that each course or hole has a cer¬ 
tain par, the number of strokes allowed according to the results 
achieved by expert players. Your own accomplishment on the 
course will be at par, above par, or below par. 

Similarly, some days you may feel up to par, other days below 
par. 

Par is from a Latin word meaning equal. You may try, when 
you play golf, to equal the expert score; and some days you may, 
or may not, feel equal to your usual self. 

When we speak of parity payments to farmers, we refer to pay¬ 
ments that show an equality to earnings for some agreed-upon 
year. 

So when you disparage, you lower someone’s par, or feeling of 

200 




equality, (dis- as you know, may be a negative prefix). The noun 
is disparagement (dis-PAIR'-sj-msnt), the adjective disparaging 
(dis-PAIR'-oj-ing), as in “Why do you always make disparaging 
remarks about me?” 

Parity (PAIR'-o-tee) as a noun means equality; disparity (dis- 
PAIR'-s-tee) means a lack of equality, or a difference. We may 
speak, for example, of the disparity between someone’s promise 
and performance; or of the disparity between the rate of vocabu¬ 
lary growth of a child and of an adult. The adjective disparate 
(DIS'-po-rat) indicates essential or complete difference or ine¬ 
quality, as in “Our philosophies are so disparate that we can never 
come to any agreement on action.” 

The word compare and all its forms ( comparable, comparative, 
etc.) derive from par, equal. Two things are compared when they 
have certain equal or similar qualities, (con-, com-, together, 
with). 

Pair and peer are also from par . Things (shoes, socks, gloves, 
etc.) in pairs are equal or similar; your peers are those equal to 
you, as in age, position, rank, or ability. Hence the expression “to 
be judged by a jury of one’s peers.” 

(British peers, however, such is the contradiction of language, 
were nobles.) 


2. how to say yes and no 

Equivocate is built on another Latin word meaning equal — 
aequus (the spelling in English is always equ -)—plus vox, vocis, 
voice. 

When you equivocate (s-KWIV'-s-kayt'), you seem to be 
saying both yes and no with equal voice . An equivocal (o-KWIV'- 
o-ksl) answer, therefore, is by design vague, indefinite, and suscep¬ 
tible of contradictory interpretations, quite the opposite of an une¬ 
quivocal (un'-o-KWIV'-a-kol) response, which says Yes! or No!, 
and no kidding. Professional politicians are masters of equivoca¬ 
tion (o-kwiv'-o-KAY'-shan)—they are, on most vital issues, mug¬ 
wumps; they sit on a fence with their mugs on one side and their 
wumps on the other. You will often hear candidates fpr office say, 
publicly, that they unequivocally promise, if elected, to ... ; and 
then they start equivocating for all they are worth, like people 


201 



who say, “Let me be perfectly frank with you”—and then 
promptly and glibly lie through their teeth. 

3. statements of various kinds 

Do not confuse equivocal with ambiguous (am'-BIG'-yOO-as). 
An equivocal statement is purposely, deliberately (and with mal¬ 
ice aforethought) couched in language that will be deceptive; an 
ambiguous statement is accidentally couched in such language. 
Equivocal is, in short, purposely ambiguous. 

You will recall that ambi which we last met in ambivert and 
ambidextrous, is a root meaning both; anything ambiguous may 
have both one meaning and another meaning. If you say, “That 
sentence is the height of ambiguity ,” you mean that you find it 
vague because it admits of both affirmative and negative inter¬ 
pretations, or because it may mean two different things. Am¬ 
biguity is pronounced am'-ba-GYdO-s-tee. 

Another type of statement or word contains the possibility of 
two interpretations—one of them suggestive, risqu6, or sexy. Such 
a statement or word is a double entendre. This is from the French 
and translates literally as double meaning. Give the word as close 
a french pronunciation as you can—D COB'-fohn-TAHN'-dro. 
(The n’s are nasalized, the r somewhat throaty, and the final sylla¬ 
ble is barely audible.)

SESSION 21 

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. more on equality 

The root aequus, spelled equ- in English words, is a building 
block of: 

1. equity (EK'-ws-tee) —justice, fairness; i.e., equal treatment. 


205 





(By extension, stocks in the financial markets are equities, and the 
value of your home or other property over and above the amount 
of the mortgage you owe is your equity in it.) The adjective is 
equitable (EK'-wa-ta-bal). 

2. inequity (in-EK'-wa-tee)—injustice, unfairness ( equity plus 
the negative prefix in-) . Adjective: inequitable (in-EK'-wa-ta- 
bal). 

3. iniquity (in-IK'-wa-tee)—by one of those delightful sur¬ 
prises and caprices characteristic of language, the change of a sin¬ 
gle letter (e to /), extends the meaning of a word far beyond its 
derivation and original denotation. Injustice and unfairness are 
sinful and wicked, especially if you naively believe that life is fair. 
So a “den of iniquity* is a place where vice flourishes; an iniquity 
is a sin or vice, or an egregiously immoral act; and iniquity is 
wickedness, sinfulness. Adjective: iniquitous (in-IK'-wa-tas). 

4. equinox (EE'-kwa-noks')—etymologically, “equal night,” a 
combination of aequus and nox, noctis, night. The equinox, when 
day and night are of equal length, occurs twice a year: about 
March 21, and again about September 21 or 22. (The adjective is 
equinoctial —ee'-kwa-NOK'-shal.) Nocturnal (nok-TURN'-al), 
derived from nox, noctis, describes people, animals, or plants that 
are active or flourish at night rather than during daylight hours. 
Cats and owls are nocturnal, as is the moonflower, whose blos¬ 
soms open at night; not to mention “night people,” whose 
biorhythms are such that they function better after the sun goes 
down, and who like to stay up late and sleep well into midmom- 
ing. A nocturne (NOK'-tum) is a musical composition of dreamy 
character (i.e., night music), or a painting of a night scene. 

5. equanimity (ee'-kwa-NIM'-a-tee or ek'-wa-NIM'-a-tee)— 
etymologically aequus plus animus, mind, hence “equal mind.” 
Maintain your equanimity, your evenness of temper, your compo¬ 
sure, your coolness or calmness, when everyone around you is get¬ 
ting excited or hysterical, and you will probably be considered an 
admirable person, though one might wonder what price you pay 
for such emotional control. (Other words built on animus, mind, 
will be discussed in Chapter 12.) 

6. Equability (ee'-kwa-BIL'-a-tee or ek'-wa-BIL'-a-tee )-a 
close synonym of equanimity. A person of equable (EE'-kwa-bal 


206 



or EK'-wo-bol) temperament is characteristically calm, serene, 
unflappable, even-tempered. 

7. equilibrium (ee'-kwa-LIB'-ree-sm)—by derivation aequus 
plus libra, balance, weight, pound, hence “equal balance.” Libra 
(LI'-bro) is the seventh sign of the zodiac, represented by a pair 
of scales. Now you know, in case the question has been bothering 
you, why the abbreviation for the word pound is lb, and why the 
symbol for the British pound, the monetary unit, is £. Equilib¬ 
rium is a state of physical balance, especially between opposing 
forces. When you are very drunk you may have difficulty keeping 
your equilibrium —the force of gravity is stronger than your abil¬ 
ity to stay upright. An equilibrist (o-KWIL'-a-brist), as you might 
guess, is a professional tightrope walker—a performer successfully 
defying the law of gravity (when sober) by balancing on a thin 
overhead wire. 

The equator divides the earth into equal halves, and words like 
equation, equivalent, equidistant, equiangular, and equilateral 
(from Latin latus, lateris, side) are self-explanatory. 


2. not to be confused with horses 

Equestrian (o-KWES'-tree-on) is someone on a horse (as pe¬ 
destrian is someone on foot); an equestrienne (o-kwes'-tree-EN') 
is a woman on a horse (if you must make the distinction); and 
equine (EE'-kwm) is like a horse, as in appearance or charac¬ 
teristics, or descriptive of horses. 

Equestrian is also an adjective referring to horseback riding, as 
an equestrian statue; and equine is also a noun, i.e., a horse. 

So the equ- in these words, from Latin equus, horse, is not to be 
confused with the equ - in the words of the previous section—that 
equ - is from aequus, equal. (Remember, also, not to confuse the 
ped- in pedestrian, from Latin pedis, foot, with the ped- in pedia¬ 
trician, from Greek paidos, child.) 

3. hear voices? 

Equivocal, you will recall, combines aequus with vox, vocis, 
voice; and vox, vocis combines with fero, to bear or carry, to form 
vociferous (vo-SIF'-or-os), etymologically “carrying (much) 


207 



voice,” hence loud, noisy, clamorous, as vociferous demands (not 
at all quiet or subtle), or the vociferous play of young children 
(“Please! Try to be quiet so Dad can get his work done!”), though 
unfortunately TV addiction has abnormally eliminated child 
noises, at least during the program breaks between commercials. 
(Vociferous will be discussed at greater length in Chapter 10.) 

If you are vocal (VO'-kol), you express yourself readily and 
freely by voice; vocal sounds are voiced; vocal music is sung; and 
you know what your vocal cords are for. 

To vocalize (VO'-ko-lIz') is to give voice to (“Vocalize your 
anger, don’t hold it in!”), or to sing the vocals (or voice parts) 
of music. (Can you write the noun form of the verb vocalize? 

--) A vocalist (VO'-ka-list) is a singer. 

And Magnavox (vox plus magnus, large) is the trade name for 
a brand of radios and TV sets.

SESSION 22 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. how to tickle 

Titillate comes from a Latin verb meaning to tickle, and may be 
used both literally and figuratively. That is (literally), you can tit¬ 
illate by gentle touches in strategic places; you are then causing an 
actual (and always very pleasant) physical sensation. Or you can 
(figuratively) titillate people, or their minds, fancies, palates (and 
this is the more common use of the word), by charm, brilliance, 
wit, promises, or in any other way your imagination can conceive. 

Titillation (tit'-s-LAY'-shan) has the added meaning of light 
sexual stimulation. (Note that both noun and verb are spelled 
with a double l, not a double t .) 


2. how to flatter 

A compliment is a pleasant and courteous expression of praise; 
flattery is stronger than a compliment and often considered insin¬ 
cere. Adulation (aj'-o-LAY'-shan) is flattery and worship carried 
to an excessive, ridiculous degree. There are often public figures 
(entertainers, musicians, government officials, etc.) who receive 
widespread adulation , but those not in the public eye can also be 
adulated, as a teacher by students, a wife by husband (and vice 
versa), a doctor by patients, and so on. (The derivation is from a 
Latin verb meaning to fawn upon.) 

The adjective adulatory (aj'-s-lo-TAWR'-ee) ends in - ory, a 
suffix we are meeting for the first time in these pages. (Other ad¬ 
jective suffixes: -gZ, -ic, -ical, - ous .) 


213 



3. ways of writing 

Proscribe, to forbid, is commonly used for medical, religious, or 
legal prohibitions. 

A doctor proscribes a food, drug, or activity that might prove 
harmful to the patient. The church proscribes, or announces a 
proscription (pro-SKRIP'-shcn) against, such activities as may 
harm its parishioners. The law proscribes behavior detrimental to 
the public welfare. 

Generally, one might concede, proscribed activities are the most 
pleasant ones—as Alexander Woolcott once remarked, if some¬ 
thing is pleasurable, it’s sure to be either immoral, illegal, or fat¬ 
tening. 

The derivation is the prefix pro-, before, plus scribo, scriptus, to 
write. In ancient Roman times, a man’s name was written on a 
public bulletin board if he had committed some crime for which 
his property or life was to be forfeited; Roman citizens in good 
standing would thereby know to avoid him. In a similar sense, the 
doctor writes down those foods or activities that are likely to com¬ 
mit crimes against the patient’s health—in that way the patient 
knows to avoid them. 

Scribo, scriptus is the building block of scores of common Eng¬ 
lish words: scribe, scribble, prescribe, describe, subscribe, script, 
the Scriptures, manuscript, typescript, etc. Describe uses the prefix 
de-, down—to describe is, etymologically, “to write down” about. 
Manuscript, combining manus, hand (as in manual labor), with 
scriptus, is something handwritten—the word was coined before 
the invention of the typewriter. The Scriptures are holy writings. 
To subscribe (as to a magazine) is to write one’s name under an 
order or contract (sub-, under, as in subway, subsurface, etc.); to 
subscribe to a philosophy or a principle is figuratively to write 
one’s name under the statement of such philosophy or principle. 

To inscribe is to write in or into (a book, for example, or metal 
or stone). A postscript is something written after (Latin post, 
after) the main part is finished. 

Note how -scribe verbs change to nouns and adjectives: 

VERB NOUN ADJECTIVE 

prescribe prescription prescriptive 

subscribe subscription subscriptive 


214 



Can you follow the pattern? 

describe _ 

inscribe - 

proscribe - 


4. it's obvious 

You are familiar with the word via, by way of, which is from 
the Latin word for road. (The Via Appia was one of the famous 
highways of ancient Roman times.) When something is obvious, 
etymologically it is right there in the middle of the road where no 
one can fail to see it—hence, easily seen, not hidden, conspicuous. 
And if you meet an obstacle in the road and dispose of it forth¬ 
with, you are doing what obviate says. Thus, if you review your 
work daily in some college subject, frenzied “cramming” at the 
end of the semester will be obviated . A large and steady income 
obviates fears of financial insecurity; leaving for work early will 
obviate worry about being late. To obviate, then, is to make un¬ 
necessary, to do away with, to prevent by taking effective meas¬ 
ures or steps against (an occurrence, a feeling, a requirement, 
etc.). The noun is obviation (ob'-vee-AY'-shan). 

Surprisingly, via, road, is the root in the English word trivial 
(tri -, three). Where three roads intersect, you are likely to find 
busy traffic, lots of people, in short a fairly public place, so you 
are not going to talk of important or confidential matters, lest you 
be overheard. You will, instead, talk of trivial (TRIV-ee-ol) things 
—whatever is unimportant, without great significance; you will 
confine your conversation to trivialities (triv'-ee-AL'-o-teez) or to 
trivia (also a plural noun, pronounced TRIV'-ee-s), insignificant 
trifles. 


5. war 

Militate derives from militis, one of the forms of the Latin noun 
meaning soldier or fighting man. If something militates against 
you, it fights against you, i.e., works to your disadvantage. Thus, 
your timidity may militate against your keeping your friends. 
(Militate is always followed by the preposition against and, like 


215 



obviate, never takes a personal subject— you don’t militate against 
anyone, but some habit, action, tendency, etc. militates against 
someone or something.) 

The adjective militant (MIL'-a-tont) comes from the same 
root. A militant reformer is one who fights for reforms; a militant 
campaign is one waged aggressively and with determination. The 
noun is militancy (MIL'-a-tan-see), and militant is also a noun 
for the person—“Sally is a militant in the Women’s Liberation 
movement.” 

Military and militia also have their origin in militis. 


6. first the bad news 

Built on Latin malus, bad, evil, to malign is to speak evil about, 
to defame, to slander. Malign is also an adjective meaning bad, 
harmful, evil, hateful, as in “the malign influence of his uncon¬ 
scious will to fail.” Another adjective form is malignant (ma- 
LIG'-nont), as in “a malignant glance,” i.e., one showing deep 
hatred, or “a malignant growth,” i.e., one that is cancerous (bad). 

The noun of malignant is malignancy (ma-LIG'-nan-see), 
which, medically, is a cancerous growth, or, generally, the condi¬ 
tion, state, or attitude of harmfulness, hatefulness, evil intent, etc. 
The noun form of the adjective malign is malignity (ma-LIG'-na- 
tee). 

Observe how we can construct English words by combining 
malus with other Latin roots. 

Add the root dico, dictus, to say or tell, to form malediction 
(mal'-a-DIK'-shan), a curse, i.e., an evil saying. Adjective: male¬ 
dictory (mal'-a-DIK'-ta-ree). 

Add the root volo, to wish, to will, or to be willing, and we can 
construct the adjective malevolent (ma-LEV'-a-lent), wishing evil 
or harm—a malevolent glance, attitude, feeling, etc. The noun is 
malevolence (ma-LEV'-a-lans). 

Add the root facio, factus, to do or make (also spelled, in Eng¬ 
lish words, fee-, fic-, factus, or, as a verb ending, -fy), to form the 
adjective maleficent (ma-LEF'-a-sant), doing harm or evil, or 
causing hurt— maleficent acts, deeds, behavior. 

Can you figure out, and pronounce, the noun form of 
maleficent? __ 


216 



A malefactor (MAL'-o-fak'-tor) is a wrongdoer, an evildoer, a 
criminal—a malefactor commits a malefaction (mal'-o-FAK'- 
shon), a crime, an evil deed. 

French is a “Romance” language, that is, a language based on 
Roman or Latin (as are, also, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and 
Romanian), and so Latin malus became French mal, bad, the 
source of maladroit (mal'-o-DROYT'), clumsy, bungling, awk¬ 
ward, unskillful, etymologically, having a “bad right hand.” (See 
adroit , Chapter 3.) The noun is maladroitness . Also from French 
mal: malaise (mo-LAYZ'), an indefinite feeling of bodily dis¬ 
comfort, as in a mild illness, or as a symptom preceding an illness; 
etymologically, “bad ease,” just as disease (dis-ease) is “lack of 
ease.” 

Other common words that you are familiar with also spring 
from Latin malus: malicious, malice, malady; and the same malus 
functions as a prefix in words like maladjusted , malcontent , mal¬ 
practice, malnutrition, etc., all with the connotation of badness .

SESSION 23 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. so now what's the good news? 

Malus is bad; boms is good. The adverb from the Latin adjec¬ 
tive bonus is bene, and bene is the root found in words that con¬ 
trast with the mal- terms we studied in the previous session. 

So benign (ba-NlN') and benignant (ba-NIG'-nant) are 
kindly, good-natured, not harmful, as in benign neglect, a benign 
judge, a benign tumor (not cancerous), a benigmnt attitude to 
malefactors and scoundrels. The corresponding nouns are benig¬ 
nity (ba-NIG'-na-tee) and benignancy (ba-NIG'-nan-see). 

A malediction is a curse; a benediction (ben'-a-DIK'-shan) is a 
blessing, a “saying good.” The adjective is benedictory (ben'-a- 
DIK'-ta-ree). 

In contrast to maleficent is beneficent (ba-NEF'-a-sant), doing 
good. The noun?_ 

In contrast to malefactor is benefactor (BEN'-a-fak'-tar), one 
who does good things for another, as by giving help, providing 
financial gifts or aid, or coming to the rescue when someone is in 
need. If you insist on making sexual distinctions, a woman who so 
operates is a benefactress (BEN'-a-fak'-tras). And, of course, 
the person receiving the benefaction (ben-a-FAK'-shan), the re¬ 
cipient of money, help, etc., is a beneficiary (ben'-a-FISH'-ar-ee 
or ben-a-FISH'-ee-air-ee). Benefit and beneficial are other com¬ 
mon words built on the combination of bene and a form of facio, 
to do or make. 

So let others be malevolent toward you—confuse them by being 
benevolent (ba-NEV'-a-lant)—wish them well. (Turn the other 
cheek? Why not?) The noun? ----. 

The adjective bonus, good, is found in English bonus, extra 
payment, theoretically—but not necessarily—for some good act; 


222 



in bonbon, a candy (a “good-good,” using the French version of 
the Latin adjective); and in bona fide (BO'-no-FID' or BO'-na- 
Fl'-dee), etymologically, “in good faith,” hence valid, without 
pretense, deception, or fraudulent intent—as a bona fide offer, a 
bona fide effort to negotiate differences, etc. Fides is Latin for 
faith or trust, as in fidelity (fa-DEL'-a-tee), faithfulness; Fido, a 
stereotypical name for a dog, one’s faithful friend; infidel (IN'-fa- 
dal), one who does not have the right faith or religion (depending 
on who is using the term), or one who has no religion (Latin in-, 
not); and infidelity (in'-fa-DEL'-a-tee), unfaithfulness, especially 
to the marriage vows. 


2. say, do, and wish 

Benediction and malediction derive from dico, dictus, to say, 
tell. Dictate, dictator, dictation, dictatorial (dik'-ta-TAWR'-ee-al) 
—words that signify telling others what to do (“Do as I say!”)— 
are built on dico, as is predict, to tell beforehand, i.e., to say that 
something will occur before it actually does (pre-, before, as in 
prescient ). 

The brand name Dictaphone combines dico with phone, sound; 
contradict, to say against, or to make an opposite statement 
(“Don’t contradict me!”; “That contradicts what I know”) com¬ 
bines dico with contra-, against, opposite; and addiction, etymo¬ 
logically “a saying to or toward,” or the compulsion to say “yes” 
to a habit, combines dico with ad-, to, toward. 

Facio, factus, to do or make (as in malefactor, benefactor ), 
has, as noted, variant spellings in English words: fee-, fic-, or, as a 
verb ending, -fy. 

Thus factory is a place where things are made (- ory, place 
where); a fact is something done (i.e., something that occurs, or 
exists, or is, therefore, true); fiction, something made up or in¬ 
vented; manufacture, to make by hand ( manus, hand, as in manu¬ 
script, manual ), a word coined before the invention of machinery; 
artificial, made by human art rather than occurring in nature, as 
artificial flowers, etc.; and clarify, simplify, liquefy, magnify (to 
make clear, simple, liquid, larger) among hundreds of other -fy 
verbs. 

Volo, to wish, to will, to be willing (as in malevolent, benevo- 


223 



lent), occurs in voluntary, involuntary, volunteer, words too fa¬ 
miliar to need definition, and each quite obviously expressing wish 
or willingness. Less common, and from the same root, is volition 
(vo-LISH'-an), the act or power of willing or wishing, as in “of 
her own volition” i.e., voluntarily, or “against her volition” 


3. if you please! 

Placate is built on the root plac - which derives from two related 
Latin verbs meaning, 1) to please, and 2) to appease, soothe, or 
pacify. 

If you succeed in placating an angry colleague, you turn that 
person’s hostile attitude into one that is friendly or favorable. The 
noun is placation (play-KAY'-shon), the adjective either placa- 
tive (PLAK'-a-tiv or PLAY'-ka-tiv) or placatory (PLAK'-a-taw- 
ree or PLAY'-ka-taw-ree). A more placatory attitude to those 
you have offended may help you regain their friendship; when 
husband and wife, or lovers, quarrel, one of them finally makes a 
placative gesture if the war no longer fulfills his or her neurotic 
needs—one of them eventually will wake up some bright morning 
in a placatory mood. 

But then, such is life, the other one may at that point be impla¬ 
cable (im-PLAK'-a-bal or im-PLAY'-ka-bal) —im - is a respelling 
of in-, not, before the letter p. One who can be soothed, whose 
hostility can be changed to friendliness, is placable (PLAK'-a-bal 
or PLAY'-ka-bal). 

Implacable has taken on the added meaning of unyielding to 
entreaty or pity; hence, harsh, relentless, as “The governor was 
implacable in his refusal to grant clemency.” 

The noun form of implacable is implacability (im-plak'-s-BIL'- 
9-tee or im-play'-ko-BIL'-a-tee). Can you write (and pronounce) 
the noun derived from placable? _—. 

If you are placid (PLAS'-id), you are calm, easygoing, serene, 
undisturbed—etymologically, you are pleased with things as they 
are. Waters of a lake or sea, or the emotional atmosphere of a 
place, can also be placid . The norm is placidity (pb-SID'-s-tee). 

If you are complacent (ksm-PLAY-sant), you are pleased with 
yourself {com-, from con-, with, together); you may, in fact, such 
is one common connotation of the word, be smug, too pleased 


224 



with your position or narrow accomplishments, too easily self- 
satisfied, and the hour of reckoning may be closer than you real¬ 
ize. (Humans, as you know, are delighted to be critical of the con¬ 
tentment of others.) 

The noun is complacence (kam-PLAY'-ssns) or complacency 
(kom-PLAY'-san-see). 

4. how to give—and forgive 

To condone is to forgive, overlook, pardon, or be uncritical of 
(an offense, or of an antisocial or illegal act). You yourself might 
or might not indulge in such behavior or commit such an offense, 
but you feel no urge to protest, or to demand censure or punish¬ 
ment for someone else who does. You may condone cheating on 
one’s income tax, shoplifting from a big, impersonal supermarket, 
or exceeding the speed limit, though you personally observe the 
law with scrupulousness. (Not everyone, however, is so charitable 
or forgiving.) The noun is condonation (kon'-do-NAY'-shon). 

Condone is built on Latin dono, to give, the root found in 
donor, one who gives; donate, to give; and donation, a gift.

TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST 

1. Keeping in mind the roots animus in equanimity and magnus 
in Magnavox or magnify, can you combine these two roots to 
form a noun meaning, etymologically, largeness of mind? 

— .Can you figure out the 

adjective form, ending in -ous, of the noun you have constucted? 


232 




2. If equilateral means equal-sided , can you construct an adjec¬ 
tive meaning two-sided? _ 

3. Trans - is a prefix meaning across. Build a verb meaning to 
write across (from one form or language to another): 

-__What is the noun derived 

from this verb? ____ 

4. What disease was so named on the erroneous assumption that 

it was caused by “bad air?”-- 

5. Facio may appear in English words as fee-. Using the prefix 

con- t together, can you form a noun sometimes used as a synonym 
for candy, cake, or ice cream (etymologically, “something made 
together”)?_ 

{Answers in Chapter 18) 


THE THRILL OF RECOGNITION 

You have been adding, over the past twenty-three sessions, 
hundreds of words to your vocabulary; you have been learning 
hundreds of prefixes, roots, and suffixes that make it possible for 
you to figure out the meaning of many unfamiliar words you may 
come across in your reading. 

As time goes on and you notice more and more of the words 
you have studied whenever you read, or whenever you listen to 
lectures, the radio, or TV, the thrill of recognition plus the imme¬ 
diate comprehension of complex ideas will provide a dividend of 
incalculable value. 

You will hear these words in conversation, and you will begin 
to use them yourself, unself-consciously, whenever something you 
want to say is best expressed by one of the words that exactly 
verbalizes your thinking. Another priceless dividend! 

So keep on! You are involved in a dividend-paying activity that 
will eventually make you intellectually rich.

-Brief Intermission Five * 


HOW TO SPEAK NATURALLY 


Consider this statement by Louis Bromfield, a noted author: “If I, 
as a novelist, wrote dialogue for my characters which was meticu¬ 
lously grammatical, the result would be the creation of a speech 
which rendered the characters pompous and unreal.” 

And this one by Jacques Baizun, former literary critic for 
Harper’s: “Speech, after all, is in some measure an expression of 
character, and flexibility in its use is a good way to tell your 
friends from the robots.” 

Consider also this puckish remark by the late Clarence Darrow: 
“Even if you do learn to speak correct English, who are you going 
to speak it to?” 

These are typical reactions of professional people to the old re¬ 
strictions of formal English grammar. Do the actual teachers of 
English feel the same way? Again, some typical statements: 

“Experts and authorities do not make decisions and rules, by 
logic or otherwise, about correctness,” said E. A. Cross, then Pro¬ 
fessor of English at the Greeley, Colorado, College of Education. 
“All they can do is observe the customs of cultivated and 
educated people and report their findings.” 

“Grammar is only an analysis after the facts, a post-mortem on 
usage,” said Stephen Leacock in How To Write . “Usage comes 
first and usage must rule.” 

One way to discover current trends in usage is to poll a cross 

234 



section of people who use the language professionally, inquiring as 
to their opinion of the acceptability, in everyday speech, of certain 
specific and controversial expressions. A questionnaire I prepared 
recently was answered by eighty-two such people—thirty-one au¬ 
thors, seven book reviewers, thirty-three editors, and eleven pro¬ 
fessors of English. The results, some of which will be detailed 
below, may possibly prove startling to you if you have been condi¬ 
tioned to believe, as most of us have, that correct English is rigid, 
unchangeable, and exclusively dependent on grammatical rules.

WRONG 


1. Californians boast of the healthy climate of their state. 

right. There is a distinction, says formal grammar, between 
healthy and healthful . A person can be healthy—l am still quoting 
the rule—if he possesses good health. But climate must be health¬ 
ful, since it is conducive to health. This distinction is sometimes 
observed in writing but rarely in everyday speech, as you have 
probably noticed. Even the dictionaries have stopped splitting 
hairs—they permit you to say healthy no matter which of the 
two meanings you intend. 

“Healthy climate” was accepted as current educated usage by 
twenty-six of the thirty-three editors who answered the ques- 


235 



tionnaire, six of the seven book reviewers, nine of the eleven pro¬ 
fessors of English, and twenty of the thirty-one authors. The 
earlier distinction, in short, is rapidly becoming obsolete. 

2. Her new novel is not as good as her first one. 

right. If you have studied formal grammar, you will recall that 
after a negative verb the “proper” word is so, not as. Is this rule 
observed by educated speakers? Hardly ever. 

In reference to the sentence under discussion, author Thomas 
W. Duncan remarked: “I always say—and write— as, much to the 
distress of my publisher’s copyreader. But the fellow is a wretched 
purist.” 

The tally on this use of as showed seventy-four for, only eight 
against. 

3. We can't hardly believe it. 

wrong. Of the eighty-two professional people who answered 
my questionnaire, seventy-six rejected this sentence; it is evident 
that can't hardly is far from acceptable in educated speech. Pre¬ 
ferred usage: We can hardly believe it. 

4. This is her . 

wrong. This substitution of her where the rule requires she 
was rejected by fifty-seven of my eighty-two respondents. Para¬ 
doxically enough, although “It’s me" and “This is me" are fully 
established in educated speech, “This is her" still seems to be con¬ 
demned by the majority of cultivated speakers. Nevertheless, the 
average person, I imagine, may feel a bit uncomfortable saying 
“This is she "—it sounds almost too sophisticated. 

This is more than an academic problem. If the voice at the 
other end of a telephone conversation makes the opening move 
with “I’d like to speak to Jane Doe . [your name, for argument’s 
sake],” you are, unfortunately, on the horns of a very real di¬ 
lemma. “This is she" may sound prissy—“This is her" may give 
the impression that you’re uneducated. Other choices are equally 
doubtful. “Talking!” is suspiciously businesslike if the call comes 
to your home, and “I am Jane Doe!” may make you feel like the 
opening line of a high school tableau. The need for a decision 
arises several times in a busy day—and, I am sorry to report, the 
English language is just deficient enough not to be of much help. I 
wonder how it would be if you just grunted affably? 


236 



5. Who are you waiting for? 

right. Formal grammar not only requires whom but demands 
that the word order be changed to: “For whom are you waiting?” 
(Just try talking with such formality on everyday occasions and 
see how long you’ll keep your friends.) 

Who is the normal, popular form as the first word of a sentence, 
no matter what the grammatical construction; and an opinion by 
Kyle Crichton, a well-known magazine editor, is typical of the 
way many educated people feel. Mr. Crichton says: “The most 
loathsome word (to me at least) in the English language is whom . 
You can always tell a half-educated buffoon by the care he takes 
in working the word in. When he starts it, I know I am faced with 
a pompous illiterate who is not going to have me long as com¬ 
pany.” 

The score for acceptance of the sentence as it stands (with 
who ) was sixty-six out of eighty-two. If, like most unpedantic 
speakers, you prefer who to whom for informal occasions, or if 
you feel as strongly about whom as Mr. Crichton does, you will be 
happy to hear that modem trends in English are all on your side. 

6. Please take care of whomever is waiting. 

wrong. Whomever is awkward and a little silly in this sentence 
and brings to mind Franklin P/ Adams’ famous remark on gram¬ 
mar: “‘Whom are you?’ asked Cyril, for he had been to night 
school.” It is also contrary to grammatical rule. People who are 
willing to be sufficiently insufferable to use whomever in this con¬ 
struction have been tempted into error by the adjacent word of . 
They believe that since they are following a preposition with an 
objective pronoun they are speaking impeccable grammar. In ac¬ 
tuality, however, whomever is not the object of the preposition of 
but the subject of the verb is waiting. Preferable form: Please take 
care of whoever is waiting. 

7. Whom would you like to be if you weren’t yourself? 

wrong. Here is another and typical example of the damage 
which an excessive reverence for whom can do to an innocent per¬ 
son’s speech. Judged by grammatical rule, whom is incorrect in 
this sentence (the verb to be requires who); judged by normal 
speech patterns, it is absurd. This use of whom probably comes 
from an abortive attempt to sound elegant. 


237 



8. My wife has been robbed. 

right —if something your wife owns was taken by means of 
thievery. However, if your wife herself was kidnapped, or in some 
way talked into leaving you, she was stolen, not robbed . To rob is 
to abscond with the contents of something—to steed is to walk off 
with the thing itself. Needless to say, both forms of activity are 
highly antisocial and equally illegal. 

9. Is this desert fattening? 

wrong. The dessert that is fattening is spelled with two s’ s. 
With one s, it’s a desert, like the Sahara. Remember the two s '*s in 
dessert by thinking how much you’d like two portions, if only 
your waistline permitted.

HOW TO TALK 

ABOUT VARIOUS SPEECH HABITS 

(Sessions 24-27 ) 


TEASER PREVIEW 

What adjective describes people who: 

• are disinclined to conversation? 

• are brief and to the point in their speech? 

• are blocked or incoherent in their speech? 

• show by their speech that they are trite and unimaginative? 

• use more words than necessary? 

• are forcefully compelling and logical in their speech? 

• talk rapidly and fluently? 

• are noisy and clamorous? 

• are talkative? 


239 



SESSION 24 


Perhaps some of your richest and most satisfying experiences have 
been with people to whom you can just talk, talk, talk. As you 
speak, previously untapped springs of ideas and emotions begin to 
flow; you hear yourself saying things you never thought you knew. 

What kinds of people might you find yourself in conversation 
with? In this chapter we start by examining ten types, discovering 
the adjective that aptly describes each one. 


IDEAS 


1. saying little 

There are some people who just don't like to talk . It’s not that 
they prefer to listen. Good listeners hold up their end of the con¬ 
versation delightfully—with appropriate facial expressions; with 
empathetic smiles, giggles, squeals, and sighs at just the right time; 
and with encouraging nods or phrases like “Go on!”, “Fantastic!”, 
“And then what happened?” 

These people like neither to talk nor to listen—they act as if 
conversation is a bore, even a painful waste of time. Try to engage 
them, and the best you may expect for your efforts is a vacant 
stare, a noncommittal grunt, or an impatient silence. Finally, in 
frustration, you give up, thinking. “Are they self-conscious? Do 
they hate people? Do they hate me? ,f 

The adjective: taciturn 


2. saying little—meaning much 

There is a well-known anecdote about Calvin Coolidge, who, 
when he was President, was often called (though probably not to 
his face) “Sflent Cal”: 


240 



A young newspaperwoman was sitting next to him at a banquet, 
so the story goes, and turned to him mischievously. 

“Mr. Coolidge,” she said, “I have a bet with my editor that I 
can get you to say more than two words to me this evening.” 

“You lose ” Coolidge rejoined simply. 

The adjective: laconic 


3. when the words won’t come 

Under the pressure of some strong emotion—fear, rage, anger, 
for example—people may find it difficult, or even impossible, to 
utter words, to get their feelings unjumbled and untangled enough 
to form understandable sentences. They undoubtedly have a lot 
they want to say, but the best they can do is sputter! 

The adjective: inarticulate 


4. much talk, little sense 

Miss Bates, a character in Emma , a novel by Jane Austen: 

“So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not 
been for this particular circumstance, of her being able to come 
here so soon. My mother is so delighted! For she is to be three 
months with us at least. Three months, she says so, positively, as I 
am going to have the pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you 
see, that die Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has per¬ 
suaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly. I

wrote a very urgent letter to her mother, or her father, I declare I 
, do not know which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane’s let¬ 
ter . . ” 


The adjective: garrulous 


5. unoriginal 

Some people are completely lacking in originality and imagina¬ 
tion—and their talk shows it. Everything they say is trite, hack- 


241 



neyed, commonplace, humorless—their speech patterns are full of 
cliches and stereotypes, their phraseology is without sparkle. 

The adjective: banal 


6 . words, words, words! 

They talk and talk and talk—it’s not so much the quantity you 
object to as the repetitiousness. They phrase,, rephrase, and re¬ 
rephrase their thoughts—using far more words than necessary, 
overwhelming you with words, drowning you with them, until 
your only thought is how to escape, or maybe how to die. 

The adjective: verbose 


7. words in quick succession 

They are rapid, fluent talkers, the words seeming to roll off their 
tongues with such ease and lack of effort, and sometimes with 
such copiousness, that you listen with amazement. 

The adjective: voluble 


8. words that convince 

They express their ideas persuasively, forcefully, brilliantly, and 
in a way that calls for wholehearted assent and agreement from an 
intelligent listener. 

The adjective: cogent 


9. the sound and the fury 

Their talk is loud, noisy, clamorous, vehement. What may be 
lacking in content is compensated for in force and loudness. 

The adjective: vociferous 


10. quantity 

They talk a lot—a whole lot They may be voluble, vociferous.

garrulous, verbose, but never inarticulate, taciturn, or laconic. No 
matter. It’s the quantity and continuity that are most conspicuous. 
“Were you vaccinated with a phonograph needle?” is the question 
you are tempted to ask as you listen. 

The adjective: loquacious 


These ten words revolve around the idea of varying kinds and 
ways of talking and not talking. Many of the adjectives are close 
in meaning, but each contains its unique difference.

Can you recall the words? 

Do you know that new nerve patterns are formed by repeated 
actions? As a very young child, you tied your shoelaces and but¬ 
toned your clothing with great concentration—the activity was 
directed, controlled, purposeful, exciting. As you grew older and 
more skillful, you tied and buttoned with scarcely a thought of 
what you were doing. Your fingers flew about their task almost au¬ 
tomatically—for the habit had formed a nerve pattern and the ac¬ 
tion needed little if any conscious attention. 

That’s simple enough to understand. If you do not remember 
your own experiences, you can observe the phenomenon of strug¬ 
gling with a skill, mastering it, and finally making it a self-starting 
habit by watching any young child. Or you can simply take my 
word for it. 

You need not take my word for the way a mastery of new 
words is acquired. You can see in yourself, as you work with this 
book, how adding words to your vocabulary is exactly analogous 
to a child’s mastery of shoelacing. First you struggle with the con¬ 
cepts; then you eventually master them; finally, by frequent work 
with the new words (now you see the reason for the great number 
of exercises, the repetitious writing, saying, thinking) you build up 
new nerve patterns and you begin to use the new words with 
scarcely any consciousness of what you are doing. 

Watch this common but important phenomenon closely as you 
do the next exercise. Your total absorption of the material so far 
has given you complete mastery of our ten basic words. Prove that 
you are beginning to form new nerve patterns in relation to these 
words by writing the one that fits each brief definition. The more 
quickly you think of the word that applies, the- surer you can be 
that using these words will soon be as automatic and unself-con-

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. about keeping one's mouth shut 

If you let your mind play over some of the taciturn people you 
know, you will realize that their abnormal disinclination to con¬ 
versation makes them seem morose, sullen, and unfriendly. Cal 
Coolidge’s taciturnity was world-famous, and no one, I am sure. 


246 





ever conceived of him as cheerful, overfriendly, or particularly so¬ 
ciable. There are doubtless many possible causes of such verbal 
rejection of the world: perhaps lack of self-assurance, feelings of 
inadequacy or hostility, excessive seriousness or introspection, or 
just plain having nothing to say. Maybe, in Coolidge’s case, he 
was saving up his words—after he did not “choose to run” in 
1928, he wrote a daily column for the New York Herald Tribune 
at a rumored price of two dollars a word—and, according to most 
critics (probably all Democrats), he had seemed wiser when he 
kept silent. Coolidge hailed from New England, and taciturnity 
(tas-o-TURN'-o-tee) in that part of the country, so some people 
say, is considered a virtue. Who knows, the cause may be geo¬ 
graphical and climatic, rather than psychological. 

Taciturn is from a Latin verb taceo, to be silent, and is one of 
those words whose full meaning cannot be expressed by any other 
combination of syllables. It has many synonyms, among them si¬ 
lent, uncommunicative, reticent, reserved, secretive, close-lipped, 
and close-mouthed;, but no other word indicates the permanent, 
habitual, and temperamental disinclination to talk implied by taci¬ 
turn. 


2. better left unsaid 

Tacit (TAS'-it) derives also from taceo. 

Here is a man dying of cancer. He suspects what his disease is, 
and everyone else, of course, knows. Yet he never mentions the 
dread word, and no one who visits him ever breathes a syllable of 
it in his hearing. It is tacitly understood by all concerned that the 
word will remain forever unspoken. 

(Such a situation today, however, may or may not be typical— 
there appears to be a growing tendency among physicians and 
family to be open and honest with people who are dying.) 

Consider another situation: 

An executive is engaging in extracurricular activities with her 
secretary. Yet during office time they are as formal and distant as 
any two human beings can well be. Neither of them ever said to 
the other, “Now, look here, we may be lovers after five o’clock, 


247 



but between nine and five we must preserve the utmost decorum, 
okay?” Such speech, such a verbal arrangement, is considered un¬ 
necessary—so we may say that the two have a tacit agreement 
(i.e., nothing was ever actually said) to maintain a complete 
employer-employee relationship during office hours. 

Anything tacit , then, is unspoken, unsaid, not verbalized. We 
speak of a tacit agreement, arrangement, acceptance, rejection, as¬ 
sent, refusal, etc. A person is never called tacit . 

The noun is tacitness (TAS'-it-nos). (Bear in mind that you 
can transform any adjective into a noun by adding - ness, though 
in many cases there may be a more sophisticated, or more com¬ 
mon, noun form.) 

Changing the a of the root taceo to i, and adding the prefix re-, 
again, and the adjective suffix -ent, we can construct the English 
word reticent (RET'-o-sont). 

Someone is reticent who prefers to keep silent, whether out of 
shyness, embarrassment, or fear of revealing what should not be 
revealed. (The idea of “againness”' in the prefix has been lost in 
the current meaning of the word.) 

We have frequently made nouns out of -ent adjectives. Write 

two possible noun forms of reticent: -, 

or, less commonly,- 


3. talk, talk, talk! 

Loquacious people love to talk. This adjective is not necessarily 
a put-down, but the implication, when you so characterize such 
people, is that you wish they would pause for breath once in a 
while so that you can get your licks in. The noun is loquacity (16- 
KWAS'-s-tee), or, of course, loquaciousness. 

The word derives from Latin loquor, to speak, a root found 
also in: 

1. soliloquy (so-LIL'-o-kwee)—a speech to oneself ( loquor 
plus solus, alone), or, etymologically, a speech when alone. 

We often talk to ourselves, but usually silently, the words going 
through our minds but not actually passing our lips. The term so - 


248 



liloquy is commonly applied to utterances made in a play by char¬ 
acters who are speaking their thoughts aloud so the audience 
won’t have to guess. The soliloquist (sa-LIL'-a-kwist) may be 
alone; or other members of the cast may be present on stage, but 
of course they don’t hear what’s being said, because they’re not 
supposed to know. Eugene O’Neill made novel uses of soliloquies 
in Mourning Becomes Electra —the characters made honest dis¬ 
closures of their feelings and thoughts to the audience, but kept the 
other players in the dark. 

The verb is to soliloquize (sa-LIL'-o-kwIz'). 

2. A ventriloquist (ven-TRIL'-o-kwist) is one who can throw 

his voice. A listener thinks the sound is coming from some source 
other than the person speaking. The combining root is Latin 
venter , ventris, belly; etymologically, ventriloquism (ven-TRIL'- 
3-kwiz-3m) is the art of “speaking from the belly.” The adjective 
is ventriloquistic (ven-tril'-s-KWIS'-tik). Can you figure out how 
the verb will end? Write the verb:-- 

3. Colloquial (ks-LO'-kwee-sl) combines loquor, to speak, 
with the prefix con -. (Con- is spelled col- before a root starting 
with l; cor- before a root starting with r; com- before a root start¬ 
ing with m, p, or b.) When people speak together they are engag¬ 
ing in conversation—and their language is usually more informal 
and less rigidly grammatical than what you might expect in writing 
or in public addresses. Colloquial patterns are perfectly correct— 
they are simply informal, and suitable to everyday conversation. 

A colloquialism (ks-LO'-kwee-s-l iz-sm), therefore, is a con¬ 
versational-style expression, like “He hasn’t got any” or “Who are 
you going with?” as contrasted to the formal or literary “He has 
none” or “With whom are you going?” Colloquial English is the 
English you and I talk on everyday occasions—it is not slangy, 
vulgar, or illiterate. 

4. A circumlocution (sur-ksm-lo-KYOO'-shsn) is, etymo¬ 
logically, a “talking around” (circum-, around). Any way of ex¬ 
pressing an idea that is roundabout or indirect is circumlocutory 
(sur'-kom-LOK'-ys-tawr'-ee)—you are now familiar with the 
common adjective suffix -ory.

SESSION 26 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1. a Spartan virtue 

In ancient Sparta, originally known as Laconia, the citizens 
were long-suffering, hard-bitten, stoical, and military-minded, and 
were even more noted for their economy of speech than Ver¬ 
monters, if that is possible. Legend has it that when Philip of 
Macedonia was storming the gates of Sparta (or Laconia), he sent 
a message to the besieged king saying, “If we capture your city we 
will bum it to the ground.” A one-word answer came back: “If.” 
It was now probably Philip’s turn to be speechless, though history 
does not record his reaction. 

It is from the name Laconia that we derive our word laconic — 
pithy, concise, economical in the use of words almost to the point 
of curtness; precisely the opposite of verbose. 

Like the man who was waiting at a lunch counter for a ham 
sandwich. When it was ready, the clerk inquired politely, “Will 
you eat it here, or take it with you?” 

“Both,” was the laconic reply. 


253 




Or like the woman who was watching a lush imbibing dry mar¬ 
tinis at a Third Avenue bar in New York City. The drunk downed 
the contents of each cocktail glass at one gulp, daintily nibbled and 
swallowed the bowl, then finally turned the glass over and ate the 
base. The stem he threw into a corner. This amazing gustatory 
feat went on for half an hour, until a dozen stems were lying shat¬ 
tered in the comer, and the drunk had chewed and swallowed 
enough bowls and bases to start a glass factory. He suddenly 
turned to the lady and asked belligerently, “I suppose you think 
I’m cuckoo, don’t you?” “Sure—the stem is the best part,” was 
the laconic answer. 

(It was doubtless this same gentleman, in his accustomed state 
of intoxication, who found himself painfully weaving his way 
along Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California—he had 
somehow gotten on a TWA jetliner instead of the subway—when 
he realized, almost too late, that he was going to bump into a 
smartly dressed young woman who had just stepped out of her 
Mercedes-Benz to go window-shopping along the avenue. He 
quickly veered left, but by some unexplainable magnetic attraction 
the woman veered in the sam& direction, again making collision 
apparently inevitable. With an adroit maneuver, the drunk swung 
to the right—the lady, by now thoroughly disoriented, did the 
same. Finally both jammed on the brakes and came to a dead 
stop, face to face, and not six inches apart; and as the alcoholic 
fumes assailed the young lady’s nostrils, she sneered at the reek¬ 
ing, swaying man, as much in frustration as in contempt: “Oh! 
How gauche!” “Fine!” was his happy response. “How goesh with 
you?” This answer, however, is not laconic, merely confused.) 

We have learned that - ness, -ity, and -ism are suffixes that 
transform adjectives into nouns—and all three can be used with 
laconic: 

. . . with characteristic laconicness (b-KON'-ok-nss) 

. . . her usual laconicity (lak'-a-NIS'-o-tee) 

... his habitual laconism (LAK'-a-niz-sm) 

. . . with, for him, unusual laconicism (la-KON'-a-siz-sm) 

A laconism is also the expression itself that is pithy and concise, 
as the famous report from a naval commander in World War II: 
“Saw sub, sank same.” 


254 



2. brilliant 

Cogent is a term of admiration. A cogent argument is well put, 
convincing, hardly short of brilliant. Cogency (KO'-jon-see) 
shows a keen mind, an ability to think clearly and logically. The 
word derives from the Latin verb cogo, to drive together, compel, 
force. A cogent argument compels acceptance because of its logic, 
its persuasiveness, its appeal to one’s sense of reason. 

3. back to talk 

You will recall that loquor, to speak, is the source of loquacity, 
soliloquy, ventriloquism, colloquialism, circumlocution . This root 
is also the base on which eloquent (EL'-o-kwont), magniloquent 
(mag-NIL'-o-kwont), and grandiloquent (gran-DIL'-o-kwsnt) 
are built 

The eloquent person speaks out (e-, from ex-, out), is vividly 
expressive, fluent, forceful, or persuasive in language (“the prose¬ 
cutor’s eloquent plea to the jury”). The word is partially synony¬ 
mous with cogent, but cogent implies irresistible logical reasoning 
and intellectual keenness, while eloquent suggests artistic expres¬ 
sion, strong emotional appeal, the skillful use of language to move 
and arouse a listener. 

Magniloquent (magnus, large) and grandiloquent ( grandis, 
grand) are virtually identical in meaning. Magniloquence or gran¬ 
diloquence is the use of high-flown, grandiose, even pompous lan¬ 
guage; of large and impressive words; of lofty, flowery, or over¬ 
elegant phraseology. Home is a place of residence; wife_is 
helpmate, helpmeet, or better half; women are the fair sex; chil¬ 
dren are offspring or progeny; a doctor is a member of the medi¬ 
cal fraternity; people are the species Homo sapiens, etc., etc. 

Loquacious, verbose, voluble, and garrulous people are all talk¬ 
ative; but each type, you will recall, has a special quality. 

If you are loquacious, you talk a lot because you like to talk 
and doubtless have a lot to say. 

If you are verbose, you smother your ideas with excess words, 
with such an overabundance of words that your listener either 
drops into a state of helpless confusion or falls asleep. 


255 



If you are voluble, you speak rapidly, fluently, glibly, without 
hesitation, stutter, or stammer; you are vocal, verbal, and highly 
articulate. 

If you are garrulous, you talk constantly, and usually aimlessly 
and meaninglessly, about trifles. We often hear the word used in 
“a garrulous old man” or “a garrulous old woman,” since in very 
advanced age the mind may wander and lose the ability to dis¬ 
criminate between the important and the unimportant, between 
the interesting and the dull. 

Verbose is from Latin verbum, word—the verbose person is 
wordy. 

Voluble comes from Latin volvo, volutus, to roll—words effort¬ 
lessly roll off the voluble speaker’s tongue. 

And garrulous derives from Latin garrio, to chatter—a garru¬ 
lous talker chatters away like a monkey. 

The suffix -ness can be added to all these adjectives to form 
nouns. Alternate noun forms end in -ity: 

verbosity (var-BOS'-a-tee) 

volubility (vol'-ya-BIL'-a-tee) 

garrulity (ga-ROOL'-a-tee) 


4. at large 

We discovered magnus, large, big, great, in Chapter 9, in 
discussing Magnavox (etymologically, “big voice”), and find it 
again in magniloquent (etymologically, “talking big”). The root 
occurs in a number of other words: 

1. Magnanimous (mag-NAN'-a-mas)—big-hearted, generous, 
forgiving (etymologically, “great-minded”). {Magnus plus 
animus, mind.) We’ll discuss this word in depth in Chapter 12. 

2. Magnate (MAG'-nayt)—a person of great power or 
influence, a big wheel, as a business magnate . 

3. Magnify —to make larger, or make seem larger {magnus 
plus -fy from facio, to make), as in ''magnify your problems.” 

4. Magnificent—magnus plus fic-, from facio. 

5. Magnitude—magnus plus the common noun suffix -tude, as 
in fortitude, multitude, gratitude, etc. 


256 



6. Magnum (as of champagne or wine)—a large bottle, gener¬ 
ally two fifths of a gallon. 

7. Magnum opus (MAG'-nsm O'-pes)—etymologically, a “big 
work”; actually, the greatest work, or masterpiece, of an artist, 
writer, or composer. Opus is the Latin word for work; the plural 
of opus is used in the English word opera, etymologically, “a 
number of works,” actually a musical drama containing overture, 
singing, and other forms of music, i.e., many musical works. The 
verb form opero, to work, occurs in operate, co-operate, operator, 
etc. 


5. words, words, words! 

Latin verbum is word. A verb is the important word in a sen¬ 
tence; verbatim (vsr-BAY'-tim) is word-for-word (a verbatim re¬ 
port). 

Verbal (VUR'-bol), ending in the adjective suffix -al, may refer 
either to a verb, or to words in general (a verbal fight); or it may 
mean, loosely, oral or spoken, rather than written ( verbal agree¬ 
ment or contract); or, describing people ( <? she is quite verbal ”), it 
may refer to a ready ability to put feelings or thoughts into words. 

Working from verbal, can you add a common verb suffix to 
form a word meaning to put into words? - 

Verbiage (VUR'-bee-aj) has two meanings: an excess of words 
(“Such verbiage!”); or a style or manner of using words (medical 
verbiage, military verbiage ). 


6. roll on, and on! 

Volvo, volutus, to roll, the source of voluble, is the root on 
which many important English words are based. 

Revolve (ro-VOLV')—roll again (and again), or keep turning 
round. Wheels revolve, the earth revolves around the sun, the cyl¬ 
inder of a revolver revolves . (The prefix is re-, back or again.) 

The noun is revolution (rev-s-LdO'-shan), which can be one 
such complete rolling, or, by logical extension, a radical change 
of any sort (TV was responsible for a revolution in the entertain¬ 
ment industry), especially political (the American, or French, 


257 



Revolution ). The adjective revolutionary (rev'-o-LcJO'-shsn-air'- 
ee) introduces us to a new adjective suffix, -ary, as in contrary, 
disciplinary, stationary, imaginary, etc. (But -ary is sometimes 
also a noun suffix, as in dictionary, commentary, etc.) 

Add different prefixes to volvo to construct two more English 
words: . 

1. involve —etymologically, “roll in’* (“I didn’t want to get in¬ 
volved!”) . Noun: involvement 

2. evolve (a-VOLV')—etymologically, “roll out” (e-, out); 
hence to unfold, or gradually develop (“The final plan evolved 
from some informal discussions”; “The political party evolved 
from a group of interested citizens who met frequently to protest 
government actions”). 

By analogy with the forms derived from revolve, can you con¬ 
struct the noun and adjective of evolve? Noun: _

SESSION 27 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. front and back—and uncles 

The ventriloquist appears to talk from the belly ( venter , ventris 
plus loquor) rather than through the lips (or such was the strange 
perception of the person who first used the word). 

Venter , ventris , belly, is the root on which ventral (VEN'- 
trol) and ventricle are built. 

The ventral side of an animal, for example, is the front or an¬ 
terior side—the belly side. 

A ventricle (VEN'-tro-kal) is a hollow organ or cavity, or, logi¬ 
cally enough, belly, as one of the two chambers of the heart, or 
one of the four chambers of the brain. The ventricles of the heart 
are the lower chambers, and receive blood from the auricles , or 
upper chambers. The auricle (AW'-ro-kol), so named because it 


263 




is somewhat ear-shaped (Latin auris, ear), receives blood from 
the veins; the auricles send the blood into the ventricles, which in 
turn pump the blood into the arteries. (It’s all very complicated, 
but fortunately it works.) 

The adjective form of ventricle is ventricular (ven-TRIK'-ys- 
for), which may refer to a ventricle , or may mean having a belly- 
like bulge . 

Now that you see how ventricular is formed from ventricle, 

can you figure out the adjective of auricle? - 

How about the adjective of vehicle? - 

Of circle? -- 

No doubt you wrote auricular (aw-RIK'-yo-lar), vehicular , and 
circular, and have discovered that nouns ending in -cle from ad¬ 
jectives ending in - cular . 

So you can now be the first person on your block to figure out 
the adjective derived from: 

clavicle: - 

cuticle: - 

vesicle: - 

testicle: -:- 

uncle: _ 

The answers of course are clavicular , cuticular, vesicular, tes¬ 
ticular —and for uncle you have every right to shout “No fair!” 
(But where is it written that life is fair?) 

The Latin word for uncle (actually, uncle on the mother’s side) 
is avunculus, from which we get avuncular (a-VUNG'-kya-lar), 
referring to an uncle. 

Now what about an uncle? Well, traditional or stereotypical un¬ 
cles are generally kindly, permissive, indulgent, protective—and 
often give helpful advice. So anyone who exhibits one or more of 
such traits to another (usually younger) person is avuncular or 
acts in an avuncular capacity. 

So, at long last, to get back to ventral If there’s a front or belly 
side, anatomically, there must be a reverse—a back side. This is 
the dorsal (DAWR'-sal) side, from Latin dorsum, the root on 
which the verb endorse (en-DAWRS') is built. 


264 



If you endorse a check, you sign it on the back side; if you en¬ 
dorse a plan, an idea, etc., you back it, you express your approval 
or support. The noun is endorsement (en-DAWRS'-mant). 


2. the noise and the fury 

Vociferous derives from Latin vox, vocis, voice (a root you met 
in Chapter 9), plus fero, to bear or carry. A vociferous rejoinder 
carries a lot of voice—i.e., it is vehement, loud, noisy, clamorous, 
shouting. The noun is vociferousness (vo-SEF'-a-ras-nas); the 
verb is to vociferate (vo-SEF'-a-rayf). Can you form the noun 
derived from the verb?__ —.. . , ... 


3. to sleep or not to sleep—that is the question 

The root fero is found also in somniferous (som-NEF'-a-ras), 
carrying, bearing, or bringing sleep. So a somniferous lecture is so 
dull and boring that it is sleep-inducing. 

Fero is combined with somnus, sleep, in somniferous . (The 

suffix -ous indicates what part of speech?- 

- ) 

Tack on the negative prefix in- to somnus to construct insomnia 
(in-SOM'-nee-a), the abnormal inability to fall asleep when sleep 
is required or desired. The unfortunate victim of this disability is 
an insomniac (in-SOM'-nee-ak), the adjective is insomnious (in- 
SOM'-nee-as). (So -ous, in case you could not answer the ques¬ 
tion in the preceding paragraph, is an adjective suffix.) 

Add a different adjective suffix to somnus to derive somnolent 
(SOM'-na-lant), sleepy, drowsy. Can you construct the noun 
form of somnolent? _ or _ 


Combine somnus with ambulo, to walk, and you have som¬ 
nambulism (som-NAM'-bya-liz-am), walking in one’s sleep. With 
your increasing skill in using etymology to form words, write the 

term for the person who is a sleepwalker.____ 

-- Now add to the word you wrote a two-letter adjective 

suffix we have learned, to form the adjective:_ 


265 



4. a walkaway 

An ambulatory (AM'-bya-la-taw'-ree) patient, as in a hospital 
or convalescent home, is finally well enough to get out of bed and 
walk around. A perambulator (pa-RAM'-bya-layMar), a word 
used more in England than in the United States, and often short¬ 
ened to pram, is a baby carriage, a vehicle for walking an infant 
through the streets (per-, through). To perambulate (pa-RAM'- 
bya-layf) is, etymologically, “to walk through”; hence, to stroll 
around. Can you write the noun form of this verb? 


To amble (AM'-bal) is to walk aimlessly; an ambulance is so 
called because originally it was composed of two stretcher-bearers 
who walked off the battlefield with a wounded soldier; and a pre¬ 
amble (PREE'-am-bal) is, by etymology, something that “walks 
before” (pre-, before, beforehand), hence an introduction or in¬ 
troductory statement, as the preamble to the U. S. Constitution 
(“We the people . . .”), a preamble to the speech, etc; or any 
event that is introductory or preliminary to another, as in “An 
increase in inflationary factors in the economy is often a preamble 
to a drop in the stock market.” 


5 . back to sleep 

Somnus is one Latin word for sleep— sopor is another. A 
soporific (sop'-a-RIF'-ik) lecture, speaker, style of delivery, etc. 
will put the audience to sleep (fic- from facio, to make), and a 
soporific is a sleeping pill. 


6. noun suffixes 

You know that -new can be added to any adjective to construct 
the noun form. Write the noun derived from inarticulate: 

___ Inarticulate is a combination of 

the negative prefix in- and Latin articulus, a joint. The inarticulate 
person has trouble joining words together coherently. If you are 
quite articulate (ahr-TIK'-ya-lat), on the other hand, you join 
your words together easily, you are verbal, vocal, possibly even 


266 



voluble. The verb to articulate (ahr-TTK-yo-layf) is to join 
(words), i.e., to express your vocal sounds—as in “Please articu¬ 
late more clearly.” Can you write the noun derived from the verb 
articulate? _ 

Another, and very common, noun suffix attached to adjectives 
is, as you have discovered, -ity. So the noun form of banal is ei¬ 
ther banalness, or, more commonly, banality (ba-NAL'-a-tee). 

Bear in mind, then, that -ness and -ity are common noun suffixes 
attached to adjectives, and - ion (or -ation) is a noun suffix fre- 
quenty affixed to verbs (to articulate—articulation; to vocalize— 
vocalization; to perambulate—perambulation ).

TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST 

1. The present participle (or -ing form) of the Latin verb 
opero, to work, is operans, working. The form operandi means of 
working. Can you figure out the literal meaning of the phrase 
modus operandi, sometimes used to signify the characteristic 
methods or procedures used by certain criminals?- 


2. Circum-, we have learned, is a prefix meaning around, as in 
circumlocution, circumference, circumcision, circumnavigation, 
etc. Thinking of the root scribo, scriptus, to write, can you figure 
out the word meaning writing, or written material, around (the 
edge of something)? __ 


3. You know the roots somnus and loquor. Can you combine 
these two roots to form an adjective meaning talking in one’s 

sleep? _____Can you 

write the noun form of this adjective?_ 


4. We have discovered auris, ear, as in auricle . Can you figure 
out the specialty of the physician called an aurist? 


274 







5. Verbal, from verbum, refers to words; oral, from os, oris , 
the mouth, refers to spoken words or sounds. Can you analyze 
aura/ and decide on its meaning?- 


6. A somnambulist walks in his sleep. What does a noctambulist 
do? ___ 


7. Soporific, combining sopor, sleep, with fic - (from facio ), to 

make, means inducing or causing sleep . Use somnus, another root 
for sleep, to construct a word that has the same form and meaning 
as soporific: _ 

8. Perambulate is to walk through . Use another Latin prefix to 

construct a verb meaning to walk around --- 


(Answers in Chapter 18) 


BECOMING ALERT TO NEW IDEAS 

Some chapters back I suggested that since words are symbols of 
ideas, one of the most effective means of building your vocabu¬ 
lary is to read books that deal with new ideas. Along that line, I 
further suggested that the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and 
psychoanalysis would be good starting points, and I mentioned a 
number of exciting books to work with. 

Needless to say, you will not wish to neglect other fields, and so 
I want to recommend, at this point, highly readable books in addi¬ 
tional subjects. All these books will increase your familiarity with 
the world of ideas—all of them, therefore, will help you build a 
superior vocabulary.

- —Brief Intermission Six -— 

DO YOU ALWAYS 
USE THE PROPER WORD? 


The fact is that grammar is getting more liberal every day. Com¬ 
mon usage has put a stamp of approval on many expressions 
which your grandmother would not have dared utter in her most 
intimate conversation—not if she believed she was in the habit of 
using good English. It is me; have you got a cold?; its a nice day; 
can I have another piece of cake?; she is a most aggravating child; 
will everybody please remove their hats —all these today represent 
perfectly correct grammar for everyday conversation. Modem 
grammar research reports that these expressions have become uni¬ 
versal in educated speech. 

However, such a liberal policy does not mean that all bars are 
down. Only a person whose speech borders on the illiterate would 
make such statements as: can you learn me to swim?; he don't live 
here no more; we ain't working so good; me and my husband are 
glad to see you . There are still certain minimum essentials of good 
English that the cultivated speaker carefully observes. 

Is your grammar as good as the next person’s? Here’s a quick 
test by which you can measure your ability. 

Check the preferable choice in each sentence, then compare 
your results with the key at the end. Allowing 4 per cent for each 
correct answer, consider 92-100 excellent, 76-88 good, 68-72 
average.

SESSION 28 


There are few of us who do not need warm and nourishing rela¬ 
tionships to lead a fulfilled life. 

Psychology makes clear that loving and being loved are impor¬ 
tant elements in emotional health, but also points out the necessity 
for expressing, rather than repressing, our hostilities. (You know 
how good you feel once you blow off steam? And how much 
closer you can become attached to someone once you directly 
and honestly vent your anger, resentment, or irritation instead of 
bottling it up and seething in fury?) 

It is a mark of your own emotional maturity if you can accept 
hostility as well as dish it out. So let us pretend, in order to en¬ 
courage you to become personally involved in the introductory ten 
words of this chapter, that each paragraph in the next few pages 
accurately describes you. What label exactly fits your personality? 


IDEAS 


1. slave driver 

You make everyone toe the mark—right down to the last centi¬ 
meter. You exact blind, unquestioning obedience; demand the 
strictest conformity to rules, however arbitrary or tyrannical; and 
will not tolerate the slightest deviation from your orders. You are, 
in short, the very epitome of the army drill sergeant. 

You are a martinet . 


2. bootlicker 

You toady to rich or influential people, catering to their vanity, 
flattering their ego. You are the personification of the traditional 


283 



ward heeler, you out-yes the Hollywood yes men. And on top of 
all these unpleasant characteristics, you’re a complete hypocrite. 
All your servile attentions and unceasing adulation spring from 
your own selfish desires to get ahead, not out of any sincere admi¬ 
ration. You cultivate people of power or property so that you can 
curry favor at the opportune moment. 

You are a sycophant . 


3. dabbler 

Often, though not necessarily, a person of independent income, 
you engage superficially in the pursuit of one of the fine arts— 
painting, writing, sculpturing, composing, etc. You do this largely 
for your own amusement and not to achieve any professional 
competence; nor are you at all interested in monetary rewards. 
Your artistic efforts are simply a means of passing time pleasantly. 

You are a dilettante . 


4. battle-ax 

You are a loud-mouthed, shrewish, turbulent woman; you’re 
quarrelsome and aggressive, possessing none of those gentle and 
tender qualities stereotypically associated with femininity. You’re 
strong-minded, unyielding, sharp-tongued, and dangerous. You 
can curse like a stevedore and yell like a fishwife—and often do. 

You are a virago. 


5. superpatriot 

Anything you own or belong to is better—simply because you 
own it or belong to it, although you will be quick to find more 
justifiable explanations. Your religion, whatever it may be, is far 
superior to any other; your political party is the only honest one; 
your neighborhood puts all others in the city in the shade; 
members of your own sex are more intelligent, more worthy, more 
emotionally secure, and in every way far better than people of the 
opposite sex; your car is faster, more fun to drive, and gets better 
gas mileage than any other, no matter in what price range; and of 


284 



course your country and its customs leave nothing to be desired, 
and inhabitants of other nations are in comparison barely civi¬ 
lized. In short, you are exaggeratedly, aggressively, absurdly, and 
excessively devoted to your own affiliations—and you make no 
bones about advertising such prejudice. 

You are a chauvinist. 


6. fanatic 

You have a one-track mind—and when you’re riding a particu¬ 
lar hobby, you ride it hard. You have such an excessive, all- 
inclusive zeal for one thing (and it may be your business, your 
profession, your husband or wife, your children, your stomach, 
your money, or whatever) that your obsession is almost absurd. 
You talk, eat, sleep that one thing—to the point where you bore 
everyone to distraction. 

You are a monomaniac. 


7. attacker 

You are violently against established beliefs* revered traditions, 
cherished customs—such, you say, stand in the way of reform and 
progress and are always based on superstition and irrationality. 
Religion, family, marriage, ethics—you weren’t there when these 
were started and you’re not going to conform simply because most 
unthinking people do. 

You are an iconoclast . 


8. skeptic 

There is no God—that’s your position and you’re not going to 
budge from it. 

You are an atheist. 


9. self-indulger 

You are, as a male, lascivious, libidinous, lustful, lewd, wanton, 
immoral—but more important, you promiscuously attempt to sat- 


285 



isfy (and are often successful in so doing) your sexual desires 
with any woman within your arm’s reach. 

You are a lecher. 


10. worrier 

You are always sick, though no doctor can find an organic 
cause for your ailments. You know you have ulcers, though medi¬ 
cal tests show a healthy stomach. You have heart palpitations, but 
a cardiogram fails to show any abnormality. Your headaches are 
caused (you’re sure of it) by a rapidly growing brain tumor—yet 
X rays show nothing wrong. These maladies are not imaginary, 
however; to you they are most real, non-existent as they may be in 
fact. And as you travel from doctor to doctor fudlely seeking 
confirmation of your imminent death, you become more and more 
convinced that you’re too weak to go on much longer. Or¬ 
ganically, of course, there’s nothing the matter with you. Perhaps 
tensions, insecurities, or a need for attention is taking the form of 
simulated bodily ills. 

You are a hypochondriac.

(End of Session 28) 


SESSION 29 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. the French drillmaster 

Jean Martinet was the Inspector General of Infantry during the 
reign of King Louis XIV—and a stricter, more fanatic drillmaster 
France had never seen. It was from this time that the French 
Army’s reputation for discipline dated, and it is from the name of 
this Frenchman that we derive our English word martinet The 
word is always used in a derogatory sense and generally shows re- 


289 




sentment and anger on the part of the user. The secretary who 
calls his boss a martinet , the wife who applies the epithet to her 
husband, the worker who thus refers to the foreman—these 
speakers all show their contempt for the excessive, inhuman disci¬ 
pline to which they are asked to submit 
Since martinet comes from a man’s name (in the Brief In¬ 
termission which follows we shall discover that a number of pic¬ 
turesque English words are similarly derived), there are no related 
forms built on the same root. There is an adjective martinetish 
(mahr-to-NET'-ish) and another noun form, martinetism , but 
these are used only rarely. 


2. a Greek “fig-shower'* 

Sycophant comes to us from the Greeks. According to Shipley’s 
Dictionary of Word Origins: 

When a fellow wants to get a good mark, he may polish up 
an apple and place it on teacher’s desk; his classmates call 
such a lad an apple-shiner. Less complimentary localities use 
the term bootlicker. The Greeks had a name for it: fig-shower. 
Sycophant is from Gr. sykon, fig, [and] phanein, to show. 
Ibis was the fellow that informed the officers in charge when 
(1) the figs in the sacred groves were being taken, or (2) when 
the Smyrna fig-dealers were dodging the tariff. 

Thus, a sycophant may appear to be a sort of “stool pigeon,” 
since the latter curries the favor of police officials by “peaching” 
on his fellow criminals. Sycophants may use this means of ingra¬ 
tiating themselves with influential citizens of the community; or 
they may use flattery, servile attentions, or any other form of in¬ 
sinuating themselves into someone’s good graces. A sycophant 
practices sycophancy (SIK'-s-fon-see), and has a sycophantic 
(sik-o-FAN'-tik) attitude. All three forms of the word are highly 
uncomplimentary—use them with care. 

Material may be so delicate or fine in texture that anything 
behind it will show through. The Greek prefix dia- means through; 
and phanein , as you now know, means to show —hence such ma¬ 
terial is called diaphanous (dl-AF'-o-nss). Do not use the adjec¬ 
tive in reference to all material that is transparent (for example. 


290 



you would not call glass diaphanous , even though you can see 
right through it), but only material that is silky, gauzy, filmy, and, 
in addition, transparent or practically transparent. The word is 
often applied to female garments—nightgowns, negligees, etc. 

3. just for one's own amusement 

Dilettante is from the Italian verb dilettare , to delight. The 
dilettante paints, writes, composes, plays a musical instrument, or 
engages in scientific experiments purely for amusement—not to 
make money, become famous, or satisfy a deep creative urge (the 
latter, I presume, being the justifications for the time that profes¬ 
sional artists, writers, composers, musicians, poets, and scientists 
spend at their chosen work). A dilettantish (dil-a-TAN'-tish) atti¬ 
tude is superficial, unprofessional; dilettantism (dil-o-TAN'-tiz- 
om) is superficial, part-time dabbling in the type of activity that 
usually engages the full time and energy of the professional artist 
or scientist. 

Do not confuse the dilettante , who has a certain amount of na¬ 
tive talent or ability, with the tyro (Tl'-ro), who is the inexpe¬ 
rienced beginner in some art, but who may be full of ambition, 
drive, and energy. To call a person a tyro is to imply that he is 
just starting in some artistic, scientific, or professional field—he’s 
not much good yet because he has not had time to develop his 
skill, if any. The dilettante usually has some skill but isn’t doing 
much with it. On the other hand, anyone who has developed con¬ 
summate skill in an Mistic field, generally allied to music, is 
called a virtuoso (vur , -ch<5b-0'-so)—like Heifetz or Menuhin on 
the violin, Horowitz or Rubinstein on the piano. Pluralize virtuoso 
in the normal way— virtuosos; or if you wish to sound more so¬ 
phisticated, give it the continental form— virtuosi (vur'-chOb-O'- 
see). Similarly, the plural of dilettante is either dilettantes or dilet¬ 
tanti (dil-o-TAN'-tee). 

The i ending for a plural is the Italian form and is common in 
musical circles. For example, libretto , the story (or book) of an 
opera, may be pluralized to libretti; concerto , a form of musical 
composition, is pluralized concertu However, the Anglicized li¬ 
brettos and concertos are perfectly correct also. Libretto is pro¬

CHUR'-to; and concerti is kan-CHUR'-tee. Suit your plural form, 
I would suggest, to the sophistication of your audience. 


4. “masculine** women 

Virago comes, oddly enough, from the Latin word for man, vir. 
Perhaps the derivation is not so odd after all; a virago, far from 
being stereotypically feminine (i.e., timid, delicate, low-spoken, 
etc.), is stereotypically masculine in personality—coarse, aggres¬ 
sive, loud-mouthed. Termagant (TUR'-mo-gsnt) and harridan 
(HAIR'-a-dan) are words with essentially the same uncompli¬ 
mentary meaning as virago. To call a brawling woman a virago, 
a termagant, and a harridan is admittedly repetitious, but is suc¬ 
cessful in relieving one’s feelings. 


5. the old man 

Nicolas Chauvin, soldier of the French Empire, so vociferously 
and unceasingly aired his veneration of Napoleon Bonaparte that 
he became the laughingstock of all Europe. Thereafter, an exag¬ 
gerated and blatant patriot was known as a chauvinist —and still is 
today. Chauvinism (SHO'-va-niz-am), by natural extension, ap¬ 
plies to blatant veneration of, or boastfulness about, any other 
affiliation besides one’s country. 

To be patriotic is to be normally proud of, and devoted to, 
one’s country—to be chauvinistic (sho'-va-NIS'-tik) is to exag¬ 
gerate such pride and devotion to an obnoxious degree. 

We might digress here to investigate an etymological side road 
down which the word patriotic beckons. Patriotic is built on the 
Latin word pater, patris, father—one’s country is, in a sense, 
one’s fatherland. 

Let us see what other interesting words are built on this same 
root 

1. patrimony (PAT'-ra-mo-nee)—an inheritance from one’s fa¬ 
ther. The -mony comes from the same root that gives us money, 
namely Juno Moneta, the Roman goddess who guarded the tem¬ 
ples of finance. The adjective is patrimonial (pat'-ra-MO'-nee- 
al). 


292 



2. patronymic (pat'-ra-NIM'-ik)—a name formed on the fa¬ 
ther’s name, like Johnson (son of John), Martinson, Aaronson, 
etc. The word combines pater, patris with Greek onyma, name. 
Onyma plus the Greek prefix syn-, with or together, forms syno¬ 
nym (SIN'-o-nim), a word of the same name (or meaning), 
etymologically “a together name.” Onyma plus the prefix anti- 
against, forms antonym (AN'-ta-nim), a word of opposite mean¬ 
ing, etymologically “an against name.” Onyma plus Greek homos, 
the same, forms homonym (HOM'-a-nim), a word that sounds 
like another but has a different meaning and spelling, like bare — 
bear, way — weigh, to — too — two, etc., etymologically “a same 
name.” A homonym is more accurately called a homophone 
(HOM'-a-fon'), a combination of homos, the same, and phone, 
sound. The adjective form of synonym is synonymous (sa-NON'- 
a-mas). Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective derived 
from: 

antonym? _ 

homonym? _ 

homophone? _ 

3. paternity (pa-TUR'-na-tee)—fatherhood, as to question some¬ 
one’s paternity, to file a paternity suit in order to collect child sup¬ 
port from the assumed, accused, or self-acknowledged father. The 
adjective is paternal (pa-TUR'-nal), fatherly. Paternalism (pa- 
TUR'-na-liz-am) is the philosophy or system of governing a coun¬ 
try/ or of managing a business or institution, so that the citizens, 
employees, or staff are treated in a manner suggesting a father- 
children relationship. (Such a system sounds, and often is, benign 
and protective, but plays havoc with the initiative, independence, 
and creativity of those in subordinate roles.) The adjective is pa¬ 
ternalistic (pa-tum'-a-LIS'-tik). 

4. patriarch (PAY'-tree-arkO—a venerable, fatherlike old man; 
an old man in a ruling, fatherlike position. Here pater, patris is 
combined with the Greek root archein, to rule. The adjective is 
patriarchal (pay'-tree-AHR'-kal), the system is a patriarchy 
(PAY'-tree-ahr'-kee). 

5. patricide (PAT'-ro-sId')—the killing of one’s father. Pater, 
patris combines with -cide, a suffix derived from the Latin verb 
caedo, to kill. The adjective is patricidal (pat-ro-SI'-dol). 


293 



This list does not exhaust the number of words built on pater , 
father, but is sufficient to give you an idea of how closely related 
many English words are. In your reading you will come across 
other words containing the letters pater or pair —you will be able 
to figure them out once you realize that the base is the word fa¬ 
ther. You might, if you feel ambitious, puzzle out the relationship 
to the “father idea” in the following words, checking with a dic¬ 
tionary to see how good your linguistic intuition is: 

1. patrician 

2. patron 

3. patronize 

4. patronizing (adj.) 

5. paterfamilias 

6. padre 


6. the old lady 

Pater, patris is father. Mater, matris is mother. 

For example: 

1. matriarch (MAY'-tree-ahrk')—the mother-ruler; the “mother 

person” that controls a large household, tribe, or country. This 
word, like patriarch, is built on the root archein, to rule. Dur¬ 
ing the reign of Queen Elizabeth or Queen Victoria, England 
was a matriarchy (MAY'-tree-ahr'-kee). Can you figure out the 
adjective form?- 

2. maternity (ma-TUR'-na-tee)—motherhood 

3. maternal (ma-TURN'-al)—motherly 

4. matron (MAY'-tran)—an older woman, one sufficiently ma¬ 
ture to be a mother. The adjective matronly (MAY'-tran-lee) 
conjures up for many people a picture of a woman no longer in 
the glow of youth and possibly with a bit of added weight in the 
wrong places, so this word should be used with caution; it may be 
hazardous to your health if the lady you are so describing is of a 
tempestous nature, or is a virago. 

5. alma mater (AL'-ma MAY'-tar or AHL'-ma MAH'-tar)— 
etymologically, “soul mother”; actually, the school or college from 
which one has graduated, and which in a sense is one’s intellectual 
mother. 


294 



6. matrimony (MAT-ro-mo'-nee)—marriage. Though this word 
is similar to patrimony in spelling, it does not refer to money , as 
patrimony does; unless, that is, you are cynical enough to believe 
that people marry for money. As the language was growing, mar¬ 
riage and children went hand in hand—it is therefore not surpris¬ 
ing that the word for marriage should be built on the Latin root 
for mother . Of course, times have changed, but the sexist nature 
of the English language has not. The noun suffix -mony indicates 
state, condition, or result, as in sanctimony, parsimony, etc. The 
adjective is matrimonial (mat'-rs-MO'-nee-sl). 

7. matricide (MAT'-ra-sId')—the killing of one’s mother. The 

adjective?__ 


7. murder most foul. . . 

Murder unfortunately is an integral part of human life, so there 
is a word for almost every kind of killing you can think of. Let’s 
look at some of them. 

1. suicide (SOO'-a-sId')—killing oneself (intentionally); -cide 
plus sui, of oneself. This is both the act and the person who has 
been completely successful in performing the act ( partially doesn’t 
count) $ also, in colloquial usage, suicide is a verb. The adjective? 


2. fratricide (FRAT'-ra-sId')—the killing of one’s brother; - cide 

plus jrater, jratris, brother. The adjective?- 

3. sororicide (sa-RAWR'-a-sId')—the killing of one’s sister; 

-cide plus soror , sister. The adjective?_____ 

4. homicide (HOM'-a-sId')—the killing of a human being; 
-cide plus homo, person. In law, homicide is the general term for 
any slaying. If intent and premeditation can be proved, the act is 
murder and punishable as such. If no such intent is present, the 
act is called manslaughter and receives a lighter punishment. Thus, 
if your mate/lover/spouse makes your life unbearable and you 
slip some arsenic into his/her coffee one. bright morning, you are 
committing murder—that is, if he/she succumbs. On the other 
hand, if you run your victim down—quite accidentally—with 


295 



your car, bicycle, or wheelchair, with no intent to kill, you 
will be accused of manslaughter —that is, if death results and if 
you can prove you didn’t really mean it. It’s all rather delicate, 
however, and you might do best to put thoughts of justifiable 
homicide out of your mind. The adjective?-- 

5. regicide (REJ'-o-sId')—the killing of one’s king, president, 
or other governing official. Booth committed regicide when he 

assassinated Abraham Lincoln. Adjective?-. 

Derivation: Latin rex, regis, king, plus -tide. 

6. uxoricide (uk-SAWR'-s-sTd')—the killing of one’s wife. 

Adjective?_Derivation: Latin 

uxor, wife, plus -tide. 

7. mariticide (ma-RIT'-o-sId')—the killing of one’s husband. 

Adjective?_Derivation: Latin 

maritus, husband, plus -tide. 

8. infanticide (in-FAN'-to-sId')—the killing of a newborn 

child. Adjective? - Derivation: 

Latin infans, inf antis, baby, plus -tide. 

9. genocide (JEN'-o-sId')—the killing of a whole race or na¬ 
tion. This is a comparatively new word, coined in 1944 by a UN 
official named Raphael Lemkin, to refer to the mass murder of 

the Jews, Poles, etc. ordered by Hitler. Adjective?_ 

- Derivation: Greek genos, race, kind, plus 

-tide. 

10. parricide (PAIR'-o-sId')—the killing of either or both par¬ 
ents. Adjective?__ 

Lizzie Borden was accused of, and tried for, parricide in the 
1890s, but was not convicted. A bit of doggerel that was popular 
at the time, and, so I have been told, little girls jumped rope to, 
went somewhat as follows: 

Lizzie Borden took an ax 

And gave her mother forty whacks— 

And when she saw what she had done, 

She gave her father forty-one.

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. brothers and sisters, wives and husbands 

Frater, brother; soror, sister; uxor, wife; and maritus, husband 
—these roots are the source of a number of additional English 
words: 


305 




1. to fraternize (FRAT'-or-mz')—etymologically, to have a 
brotherly relationship (with). This verb may be used to indicate 
social intercourse between people, irrespective of sex, as in, 
“Members of the faculty often fraternized after school hours.” 

Additionally, and perhaps more commonly, there may be the 
implication of having a sqcial relationship with one’s subordinates 
in an organization, or even with one’s so-called inferiors, as in, 
“The president of the college was reluctant to fraternize with fac¬ 
ulty members, preferring to keep all her contacts with them on an 
exclusively professional basis”; or as in, “The artist enjoyed frat¬ 
ernizing with thieves, drug addicts, prostitutes, and pimps, pardy 
out of social perversity, partly to find interesting faces to put in his 
paintings.” 

The verb also gained a new meaning during and after World 
War II, when soldiers of occupying armies had sexual relations 
with the women of conquered countries, as in, “Military personnel 
were strictly forbidden to fraternize with the enemy.” (How 
euphemistic can you get?) 

Can you write the noun form of fraternize? __ 


2. fraternal (fro-TUR'-nd)—brotherly. The word also desig¬ 
nates non-identical (twins). 

3. fraternity (fra-TUR'-no-tee)—a men’s organization in a high 
school or college, often labeled with Greek letters (the Gamma 
Delta Epsilon Fraternity) ; or any group of people of similar inter¬ 
ests or profession (the medical fraternity , the financial fraternity). 

4. sorority (ss-RAWR'-o-tee)—a women’s organization in 
high school or college, again usually Greek-lettered; or any 
women’s social club. 

5. uxorious (uk-SAWR'-ee-as)—an adjective describing a man 
who excessively, even absurdly, caters to, dotes on, worships, and 
submits to the most outlandish or outrageous demands of, his 
wife. This word is not synonymous with henpecked , as the hen¬ 
pecked husband is dominated by his wife, perhaps because of his 
own fear or weakness, while the uxorious husband is dominated 
only by his neurosis, and quite likely the wife finds his ux¬ 
oriousness (uk-SAWR'-ee-as-nas) comical or a pain in the neck. 
(There can, indeed, be too much of a good thing!) 


306 



6. uxorial —pertaining to, characteristic of, or befitting, a wife, 
as uxorial duties, privileges, attitudes, etc. 

7. marital (MAIR'-a-tal)—etymologically, pertaining or refer¬ 
ring to, or characteristic of, a husband; but the meaning has 
changed to include the marriage relationship of both husband and 
wife (don’t ever let anyone tell you that our language is not 
sexist!), as marital duties, obligations, privileges, arguments, etc. 
Hence extramarital is literally outside the marriage, as in extra¬ 
marital affairs (hanky-panky with someone other than one’s 
spouse). And premarital (Latin prefix pre before) describes 
events that occur before a planned marriage, as premarital sex, a 
premarital agreement as to die division of property, etc. 


2. of cabbages and kings (without the cabbage) 

Rex, regis is Latin for king. Tyrannosaurus rex was the king 
(i.e., the largest) of the dinosaurs (etymologically, “king of the 
tyrant lizards”). Dogs are often named Rex to fool them into 
thinking they are kings rather than slaves. And regal (REE'-gal) 
is royal, or fit for a king, hence magnificent, stately, imperious, 
splendid, etc., as in regal bearing or manner, a regal mansion, a 
regal reception, etc. The noun is regality (ra-GAL'-a-tee). 

Regalia (ra-GAYL'-ya), a plural noun, designated the emblems 
or insignia or dress of a king, and now refers to any impressively 
formal clothes; or, more commonly, to the decorations, insignia, 
or uniform of a rank, position, office, social club, etc. “The 
Shriners were dressed in full regalia,” “The five-star general ap¬ 
peared in full regalia,” etc. 


3. “madness” of all sorts 

The monomaniac develops an abnormal obsession in respect to 
one particular thing (Greek monos, one), but is otherwise nor¬ 
mal. The obsession itself, or the obsessiveness, is monomania 
(mon'-a-MAY'-nee-a), the adjective is monomaniacal (mon'-a- 
ma-Nl'-a-kal). Monomaniacal, like the adjective forms of various 
other manias, is tricky to pronounce—practice carefully to make 
sure you can say it correctly without stuttering. 


307 



Psychology recognizes other abnormal states, all designating ob¬ 
sessions, and built on Greek mania, madness. 

1. dipsomania (dip'-sa-MAY'-nee-a)—morbid compulsion to 
keep on absorbing alcoholic beverages (Greek dipsa, thirst). The 
dipsomaniac has been defined as the person for whom one drink is 
too many, a thousand not enough. Recent investigations suggest 
that dipsomania, or alcoholism, may not necessarily be caused by 
anxieties or frustrations, but possibly by a metabolic or physio¬ 
logical disorder. 

Adjective: dipsomaniacal (dip'-sa-ma-Nl'-a-kal). 

2. kleptomania (klep'-ta-MA Y'-nee-a)—morbid compulsion to 
steal, not from any economic motive, but simply because the 
urge to take another’s possessions is irresistible. The kleptomaniac 
(Greek klepte, thief) may be wealthy, and yet be an obsessive 
shoplifter. The kleptomaniac, for reasons that psychologists are 
still arguing about, is more often a female than a male, and may 
pinch her best friend’s valueless trinket, or a cheap ashtray or salt 
shaker from a restaurant, not because she wants, let alone needs, 
the article, but because she apparently can’t help herself; she gets 
carried away. (When she arrives home, she may toss it in a 
drawer with other loot, and never look at it again.) 

Can you write (and correctly pronounce) the adjective? 


3. pyromania (pI'-ra-MAY'-nee-a)—morbid compulsion to set 
fires. Pyromania should not be confused with incendiarism (in- 
SEN'-dee-a-riz-am), which is the malicious and deliberate burning 
of another’s property, and is not a compulsive need to see the 
flames and enjoy the thrill of the heat and the smoke. Some pyro- 
maniacs join volunteer fire companies, often heroically putting out 
the very blazes they themselves have set. An incendiary (in-SEN'- 
dee-air-ee) is antisocial, and usually sets fires for revenge. Either of 
these two dangerous characters is called, colloquially, a “firebug.” 

In law, setting fire to another’s, or to one’s own, property for 
the purpose of economic gain (such as the collection of the pro¬ 
ceeds of an insurance policy) is called arson (AHR'-san) and is a 
felony. The pyromaniac sets fire for the thrill; the incendiary for 
revenge; the arsonist (AHR'-sa-nist) for money. 

Pyromania is built on Greek pyros, fire; incendiarism on Latin 
incendo, incensus, to set fire; arson on Latin ardo, arsus, to bum.

4. megalomania (meg'-s-ls-MAY'-nee-s)—morbid delusions 
of grandeur, power, importance, godliness, etc. Jokes accusing the 
heads of governments of megalomania are common. Here’s an old 
chestnut from the forties: 

Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin were talking about their 
dreams. 

Churchill: I dreamed last night that God had made me 
Prime Minister of the whole world. 

Roosevelt: I dreamed that God had made me President of 
the whole world. 

Stalin: How could you gentlemen have such dreams? 7 
didn’t dream of offering you those positions! 

Hitler, Napoleon, and Alexander the Great have been called 
megalomaniacs —all three certainly had delusions about their in¬ 
vincibility. 

Can you write (and pronounce correctly!) the adjective derived 

from megalomaniac? - 

Megalomania is built on Greek me gas, great, big, large, plus 
mania . 

[Can you think of the word for what someone speaks through 
to make the sound (phone) of his voice greater? - 


5. nymphomania (nim'-fa-MAY'-nee-a)—morbid, incessant, 
uncontrollable, and intense desire, on the part of a female, for 
sexual intercourse (from Greek nymphe, bride, plus mania). 

The person? ___ 

The adjective? _ 

6. satyromania (sc-teer'-s-MAY'-nee-a)—the same morbid, in¬ 
cessant, etc. desire on the part of a male (from Greek satyros, 
satyr, plus mania). 

The person? --- 

The adjective? __ 


309 


A satyr (SAY'-ter) was a mythological Greek god, notorious 
for lechery. He had horns, pointed ears, and the legs of a goat; the 
rest of him was in human form. Satyromania is also called sat¬ 
yriasis (sat'-a-RI'-s-sis). 


4. and now phobias 

So much for maniacs. There is another side to the coin. Just as 
personality disorders can cause morbid attraction toward certain 
things or acts (stealing, fire, power, sex, etc.), so also other emo¬ 
tional ills can cause violent or morbid repulsions to certain condi¬ 
tions, things, or situations. There are people who have irrational 
and deep-seated dread of cats, dogs, fire, the number thirteen, 
snakes, thunder or lightning, various colors, and so on almost 
without end:* Such morbid dread or fear is called, in the language 
of psychology, a phobia, and we might pause to investigate the 
three most common ones. These are: 

1. claustrophobia ( klaw'-strn-FO'-b ee-s )—morbid dread of 
being physically hemmed in, of enclosed spaces, of crowds, etc. 
From Latin claustrum, enclosed place, plus Greek phobia, morbid 
fear. The person: claustrophobe (KLAW'-strs-fob'). Adjective: 
claustrophobic (klaw'-stra-FO'-bik). 

2. agoraphobia (ag'-a-ra-FO'-bee-a)—morbid dread of open 
space, the reverse of claustrophobia. People suffering from agora¬ 
phobia prefer to stay shut in their homes as much as possible, 
and become panic-stricken in such places as open fields, large pub¬ 
lic buildings, airport terminals, etc. From Greek agora, market 
place, plus phobia. 

The person? -- 

The adjective? ___ 

3. acrophobia (ak'-ra-FO'-bee-a)—morbid dread of high 
places. The victims of this fear will not climb ladders or trees, or 
stand on tops of furniture. They refuse to go onto the roof of a 
building or look out the window of one of the higher floors. From 
Greek akros, highest, plus phobia.

SESSION 31 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1. no reverence 

The iconoclast sneers at convention and tradition, attempts to 
expose our cherished beliefs, our revered traditions, or our stereo¬ 
typical thinking as shams and myths. H. L. Mencken was the great 
iconoclast of the 1920s; Tom Wolfe {The Kandy-Kolored Tan¬ 
gerine-Flake Streamline Baby), of the 1960s. 

Adolescence is that confused and rebellious time of life in 
which iconoclasm (l-KON'-a-kl az'-am) is quite normal—indeed 
the adolescent who is not iconoclastic (I-kon'-o-KLAST'-ik) to 
some degree might be considered either immature or maladjusted. 
The words are from eikon, a religious image, plus klaein , to 
break. Iconoclasm is not of course restricted to religion. 

2. is there a God? 

Atheist combines the Greek negative prefix a- with theos, God. 
Do not confuse atheism (AY'-thee-iz-am) with agnosticism (ag- 
NOS'-ta-siz-am), the philosophy that claims that God is unknowa¬ 
ble, that He may or may not exist, and that human beings can 
never come to a final conclusion about Him. The agnostic (ag- 
NOS'-tik) does not deny the existence of a deity, as does the athe¬ 
ist , but simply holds that no proof can be adduced one way or the 
other. 

3. how to know 

Agnostic (which is also an adjective) is built on the Greek root 
gnostos, known, and the negative prefix a -. An agnostic claims 
that all but material phenomena is unknown, and, indeed, un¬ 
knowable. 

A diagnosis (dl-ag-NO'-sis), constructed on the allied Greek 

318 



root gnosis , knowledge, plus dia -, through, is a knowing through 
examination or testing. A prognosis (prog-NO'-sis), on the other 
hand, is etymologically a knowing beforehand, hence a prediction, 
generally, but not solely, as to the course of a disease. (The Greek 
prefix pro-, before, plus gnosis.) 

Thus, you may say to a doctor: “What’s the diagnosis, Doc?” 

“Diabetes.” 

Then you say, “And what’s the prognosis?” 

“If you take insulin and watch your diet, you’ll soon be as good 
as hew.” 

The doctor’s prognosis, then, is a forecast of the development 
or trend of a disease. The doctor knows beforehand, from previ¬ 
ous similar cases, what to expect. 

The verb form of diagnosis is diagnose (dl'-sg-NoS'); the verb 
form of prognosis is prognosticate (prog-NOS'-to-kayt'). To use 
the verb prognosticate correctly, be sure that your meaning in¬ 
volves the forecasting of developments from a consideration of 
symptoms or conditions—whether the problem is physical, men¬ 
tal, political, economic, psychological, or what have you. 

In school, you doubtless recall taking diagnostic (dl'-og-NOS'- 
tik) tests; these measured not what you were supposed to have 
learned during the semester, but your general knowledge in a field, 
so that your teachers would know what remedial steps to take, just 
as doctors rely on their diagnosis to decide what drugs or treat¬ 
ments to prescribe. 

In a reading center, various diagnostic machines and tests are 
used—these tell the clinician what is wrong with a student’s read¬ 
ing and what measures will probably increase such a student’s 
reading efficiency. 

The medical specialist in diagnosis is a diagnostician (df- 
sg-nos-TISH'-on). 

The noun form of the verb prognosticate is prognostication 
(prog-nos'-to-KA Y'-shon). 


4. getting back to God 

Theos, God, is also found in: 

1. Monotheism (MON'-o-thee-iz-sm)—belief in one God. 
(Monos, one, plus theos, God.) 


319 



Using atheism, atheist, and atheistic as a model, write the word 

for the person who believes in one God:-- 

The adjective?_. 

2. Polytheism (POL'-ee-thee-iz-am)—belief in many gods, as 
in ancient Greece or Rome. (Polys, many, plus theos .) 

The person with such a belief?-. 

The adjective? __ 

3. Pantheism (PAN'-thee-iz-am)—belief that God is not in 
man’s image, but is a combination of all forces of the universe. 

(Pan, all, plus theos.) The person? --- 

The adjective?_ 

4. Theology (thee-OL'-a-jee)—the study of God and religion. 
(Theos plus logos, science or study.) 

The student is a theologian (thee'-a-LO'-jan), the adjective is 
theological (thee'-a-LOJ'-a-kal). 


5. of sex and the tongue 

A lecher practices lechery (LECH'-ar-ee). The derivation is 
Old French lechier, to lick. The adjective lecherous (LECH'-a- 
ras) has many close or not-so-close synonyms, most of them 
also, and significantly, starting with the letter l, a sound formed 
with the tongue, supposedly the seat of sensation. 

1. libidinous (la-BID'-a-nas)—from libido, pleasure. 

2. lascivious (Ia-SIV'-ee-as)—from lascivia, wantonness. 

3. lubricious (loo-BRISH'-as)—from lubricus, slippery, the 
same root found in lubricate. The noun is lubricity (100-BRIS'- 
a-tee). 

4. licentious (H-SEN'-shas)—from licere, to be permitted, the 
root from which we get license, etymologically, “permission,” and 
illicit, etymologically, “not permitted.” 

5. lewd —the previous four words derive from Latin, but this 
one is from Anglo-Saxon lewed, vile. 

6. lustful —from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning pleasure, de¬ 
sire . Noun: lust. 


320 



Libidinous, lascivious, lubricious, licentious, lewd, lecherous, 
lustful axe seven adjectives that indicate sexual desire and/or ac¬ 
tivity. The implication of all seven words is more or less deroga¬ 
tory. 

Each adjective becomes a noun with the addition of the noun 
suffix -ness; lubricity and lust are alternate noun forms of two of 
the adjectives. 


6. of sex and the Itch 

Prurient (PROO'-ee-snt), from Latin prurio, to itch, to long 
for, describes someone who is filled with great sexual curiosity, 
desire, longing, etc. Can you form the noun?--- 

Pruritis (probr-I'-tis), from the same root, is a medical condi¬ 
tion in which the skin is very itchy, but without a rash or erup¬ 
tions. (Scratch enough, of course, as you will be irresistibly 
tempted to do, and something like a rash will soon appear.) The 
adjective is pruritic (proor-IT'-ik). 


7. under and over 

Hypochondria (hl-pa-KON'-dree-o) is built on two Greek 
roots: hypos, under, and chondros, the cartilage of the breast¬ 
bone. This may sound farfetched until you realize that under the 
breastbone is the abdomen; the ancient Greeks believed that mor¬ 
bid anxiety about one’s health arose in the abdomen—and no one 
is more mdrbidly, unceasingly, and unhappily anxious about 
health than the hypochondriac . 

Hypochondriac is also an adjective—an alternate and more 
commonly used adjective form is hypochondriacal (hf-po-kon- 
DRF-o-kal). 

Hypos, under, is a useful root to know. The hypodermic needle 
penetrates under the skin; a hypothyroid person has an under¬ 
working thyroid gland; hypotension is abnormally low blood pres¬ 
sure. 


321 



On the other hand, hyper is the Greek root meaning over. The 
hypercritical person is excessively fault-finding; hyperthyroidism is 
an overworking of the thyroid gland; hypertension is high blood 
pressure; and you can easily figure out the meanings of hyper¬ 
acidity, hyperactive, hypersensitive, etc. 

The adjective forms of hypotension and hypertension are hypo¬ 
tensive and hypertensive.

MAGAZINES THAT WILL HELP YOU 

When a pregnant woman takes calcium pills, she must make 
sure also that her diet is rich in vitamin D, since this vitamin 
makes the absorption of the calcium possible. In building your vo¬ 
cabulary by learning great quantities of new words, you too must 
take a certain vitamin, metaphorically speaking, to help you ab¬ 
sorb, understand, and remember these words. This vitamin is 
reading—for it is in books and magazines that you will find the 
words that we have been discussing in these pages. To learn new 
Words without seeing them applied in the context of your reading 
is to do only half the job and to run the risk of gradually forget¬ 
ting the additions to your vocabulary. To combine your vocabu¬ 
lary-building with increased reading is to make assurance doubly 
sure. 

You are now so alert to the words and roots we have discussed 
that you will find that most of your reading will be full of the new 
words you have learned—and every time you do see one of the 
words used in context in a book or magazine, you will understand 
it more fully and will be taking long steps toward using it yourself. 

Among magazines, I would like particularly to recommend the 
following, which will act both to keep you mentally alert and to 
set the new words you are learning: 

1. Harpers Magazine 

2. Atlantic Monthly 

3. The New Yorker 

4. Time 

5. Newsweek 

6. Esquire 


335 





7. Psychology Today 

8. Saturday Review 

9. Ms. 

10. Mother Jones 

11. Signs 

12. National Geographic 

13. Smithsonian 

14. Human Nature 

15. Scientific American 

16. Natural History 

These periodicals are aimed at the alert, verbally sophisticated, 
educated reader; you will see in them, without fail, most of the 
words you have been studying in this book—not to mention hosts 
of other valuable words you will want to add to your vocabulary, 
many of which you will be able to figure out once you recognize 
their etymological structure.

-Brief Intermission Seven- 


SOME INTERESTING DERIVATIONS 


PEOPLE WHO MADE OUR LANGUAGE 


Bloomers 

Mrs. Elizabeth Smith Miller invented them in 1849, and 
showed a working model to a famous women’s rights advocate, 
Amelia J. Bloomer. Amelia was fascinated by the idea of gar¬ 
ments that were both modest (they then reached right down to the 
ankles) and convenient—and promptly sponsored them. . . . 


Boycott 

Charles C. Boycott was an English land agent who$e difficult 
duty it was to collect high rents from Irish farmers. In protest, the 
farmers ostracized him, not even allowing him to make purchases 
in town or hire workers to harvest his crops. 


Marcel 

Marcel was an ingenious Parisian hairdresser who felt he could 
improve on the button curls popular in 1875. He did, and made ^ 
fortune. 


337 



Silhouette 


Finance Minister of France just before the Revolution, Etienne 
de Silhouette advocated the simple life, so that excess money 
could go into the treasury instead of into luxurious living. And the 
profile is the simplest form of portraiture, if you get the connec¬ 
tion. 


Derrick 

A seventeenth-century English hangman, Derrick by name, 
hoisted to their death some of the most notorious criminals of the 
day. 


Sadist 

Because Count de Sade t an eighteenth-century Frenchman, 
found his greatest delight in torturing friends and mistresses, the 
term sadist was derived from his name. His works shocked his na¬ 
tion and the world by the alarming frankness with which he de¬ 
scribed his morbid and bloodthirsty cruelty. 


Galvanism 

Luigi Galvani, the Italian physiologist, found by accident that an 
electrically charged scalpel could send a frog’s corpse into muscu¬ 
lar convulsions. Experimenting further, he eventually discovered 
the principles of chemically produced electricity. His name is re¬ 
sponsible not only for the technical expressions galvanism , galva¬ 
nized iron , and galvanometer , but also for that highly graphic 
phrase, “galvanized into action.” 


Guppies 

In 1868, R. J. Lechmere Guppy , president of the Scientific As¬ 
sociation of Trinidad, sent some specimens of a tiny tropical fish 
to the British Museum. Ever since, fish of this species have been 
called guppies . 


338 



Nicotine 


Four hundred years ago, Jean Nicot, a French ambassador, 
bought some tobacco seeds from a Flemish trader. Nicot’s suc¬ 
cessful efforts to popularize the plant in Europe brought him lin¬ 
guistic immortality. 


PLACES THAT MADE OUR LANGUAGE 


Bayonne, France 

Where first was manufactured the daggerlike weapon that fits

SESSION 32 


Words are the symbols of emotions, as well as ideas. You can 
show your feeling by the tone you use (“You’re silly” can be an 
insult, an accusation, or an endearment, depending on how you 
say it) or by the words you choose (you can label a quality either 
“childish” or “childlike,” depending on whether you admire it or 
condemn it—it’s the same quality, no matter what you call it). 

In Chapter 11 we discussed ten basic words that you might use 
to show your disapproval. In this chapter we discuss ten adjectives 
that indicate wholehearted approval. 

Consider the interesting types of people described in the follow¬ 
ing paragraphs, then note how accurately the adjective applies to 
each type. 


IDEAS 


1. put the kettle on, Polly 

They are friendly, happy, extroverted, and gregarious—the sort 
of people who will invite you out for a drink, who like to transact 
business around the lunch table, who put the coffee to perking as 
soon as company drops in. They’re sociable, genial, cordial, 
affable—and they like parties and all the eating and drinking that 
goes with them. 

The adjective is: convivial 


2. you can’t tire them 

Arnold Bennett once pointed out that we all have the same 
amount of time—twenty-four hours a day. Strictly speaking, that’s 
as inconclusive an observation as Bennett ever made. It’s not time 


342 



--,---—- -- j - 

very different amounts, from the persons who wake up tired, no 
matter how much sleep they’ve had, to lucky, well-adjusted mor¬ 
tals who hardly ever need to sleep. 

Energy comes from a healthy body, of course; it also comes 
from a psychological balance, a lack of conflicts and insecurities. 

Some people apparently have boundless, illimitable energy— 
they’re on the go from morning to night, and often far into the 
night, working hard, playing hard, never tiring, never “pooped” or 
“bushed”—and getting twice as much done as any three other 
human beings. 

The adjective is: indefatigable 


3. no tricks, no secrets 

They are pleasingly frank, utterly lacking in pretense or 
artificiality, in fact quite unable to hide their feelings or thoughts 
—and so honest and aboveboard that they can scarcely conceive 
of trickery, chicanery, or dissimulation in anyone. There is, then, 
about them the simple naturalness and unsophistication of a child. 

The adjective is: ingenuous 


4. sharp as a razor 

They have minds like steel traps;, their insight into problems 
that would confuse or mystify people of less keenness or discern¬ 
ment is just short of amazing. 

The adjective is: perspicacious 


5. no placating necessary 

They are most generous about forgiving a slight, an insult, an 
injury. Never do they harbor resentment, store up petty grudges, 
or waste energy or thought on means of revenge or retaliation. 
How could they? They’re much too big-hearted. 

The adjective is: magnanimous 

343 


6. one-person orchestras 

The range of their aptitudes is truly formidable. If they are 
writers, they have professional facility in poetry, fiction, biogra¬ 
phy, criticism, essays—you just mention it and they’ve done it, 
and very competently. If they are musicians, they can play the 
oboe, the bassoon, the French horn, the bass viol, the piano, the 
celesta, the xylophone, even the clavichord if you can dig one up. 
If they are artists, they use oils, water colors, gouache , charcoal, 
pen and ink—they can do anything! Or maybe the range of their 
abilities cuts across all fields, as in the case of Michelangelo, who 
was an expert sculptor, painter, poet, architect, and inventor. In 
case you’re thinking “Jack of all trades . . . ,” you’re wrong— 
they’re masters of all trades. 

The adjective is: versatile 


7. no grumbling 

They bear their troubles bravely, never ask for sympathy, never 
yield to sorrow, never wince at pain. It sounds almost superhu¬ 
man, but it’s true. 

The adjective is: stoical 


8. no fear 

There is not, as the hackneyed phrase has it, a cowardly bone in 
their bodies. They are strangers to fear, they’re audacious, daunt¬ 
less, contemptuous of danger and hardship. 

The adjective is: intrepid 


9. no dullness 

They are witty, clever, delightful; and naturally, also, they are 
brilliant and entertaining conversationalists. 

The adjective is: scintillating 


344 



10. city slickers 

They are cultivated, poised, tactful, socially so experienced, so¬ 
phisticated, and courteous that they’re at home in any group, at 
ease under all circumstances of social intercourse. You cannot 
help admiring (perhaps envying) their smoothness and self-as¬ 
surance, their tact and congeniality. 

The adjective is: urbane

SESSION 33 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. eat, drink, and be merry 

The Latin verb vivo, to live, and the noun vita , life, are the 
source of a number of important English words. 

Convivo is the Latin verb to live together; from tins, in Latin, 
was formed the noun convivium (don’t get impatient; we’ll be 
back to English directly), which meant a feast or banquet; and 
from convivium we get our English word convivial, an adjective 
that describes the kind of person who likes to attend feasts and 
banquets, enjoying (and supplying) the jovial good fellowship 
characteristic of such gatherings. 

Using the suffix -ity can you write the noun form of the adjec¬ 
tive convivial? -(Can you pro¬ 

nounce it?) 


2. living it up 

Among many others, the following English words derive from 
Latin vivo, to live: 

1. vivacious (vx-VAY'-shos)—full of the joy of living; ani¬ 
mated; peppy—a vivacious personality. Noun: vivacity (vI-VAS'- 
o-tee). You can, as you know, also add -ness to any adjective to 
form a norm. Write the alternate noun form of vivacious: 


2. vivid —possessing the freshness of life; strong; sharp—a 
vivid imagination; a vivid color. Add -ness to form the noun: 


3. revive (ro-VlV')—bring back to life. In the 1960s, men’s 
fashions of the twenties were revived . Noun: revival (ra-VT-vol). 

4. vivisection (viv'-o-SEK'-shan)—operating on a live animal. 




Sect- is from a Latin verb meaning to cut . Vivisection is the proc¬ 
ess of experimenting on live animals to discover causes and cures 
of disease. Antivivisectionists object to the procedure, though 
many of our most important medical discoveries were made 
through vivisection . 

5. Viviparous (vl-VIP'-sr-os)—producing live babies. Human 
beings and most other mammals are viviparous . Viviparous is 
contrasted to oviparous (o-VIP'-sr-ss), producing young from 
eggs. Most fish, fowl, and other lower forms of life are oviparous . 

The combining root in both these adjectives is Latin pareo, to 
give birth ( parent comes from the same root). In oviparous , the 
first two syllables derive from Latin ovum, egg. 

Ovum, egg, is the source of oval and ovoid, egg-shaped; ovulate 
(O'-vyo-layt'), to release an egg from the ovary: ovum (O-vom), 
the female germ cell which, when fertilized by a sperm, develops 
into an embryo, then into a fetus (FEE'-tas), and finally, in about 
280 days in the case of humans, is bom as an infant. 

The adjective form of ovary is ovarian (o-VAIR'-ee-an); of 
fetus, fetal (FEE'-tal). Can you write the noun form of the verb 
ovulate? _ 

Love, you may or may not be surprised to hear, also comes 
from ovum. 

No, not the kind of love you’re thinking of. Latin ovum became 
oeuf in French, or with “the” preceding the noun (the egg), 
Voeuf, pronounced something like LOOF. Zero (picture it for a 
moment) is shaped like an egg (0), so if your score in tennis is 
fifteen, and your opponent’s is zero, you shout triumphantly, 
fifteen love! Let’s go!” 


3. more about life 
Latin vita, life, is the origin of: 

1 . vital (Vl'-tal)—essential to life; of crucial importance—a 
vital matter; also full of life, strength, vigor, etc. Add the suffix 

-ity to form the noun:_Add a 

verb suffix to'construct the verb:-- 

(meaning: to give life to). Finally, write the noun derived from 
the verb you have constructed:- 


349 



2. Revitalize (ree-VP-te-Hz') is constructed from the prefix re 
again, back, the root vita , and the verb suffix. Meaning? 

-:_.. Can you write the noun formed 

from this verb?_1__ 

3. The prefix de- has a number of meanings, one of which is es¬ 
sentially negative, as in defrost , decompose, declassify, etc. Using 
this prefix, can you write a verb meaning to rob of life, to take life 

from? _Now write the noun 

form of this verb:_ 

4. Vitamin —one of the many nutritional elements on which life 
is dependent. Good eyesight requires vitamin A (found, for ex¬ 
ample, in carrots); strong bones need vitamin D (found in sun¬ 
light and cod-liver oil); etc. 

Vitalize, revitalize, and devitalize are used figuratively—for ex¬ 
ample, a program or plan is vitalized, revitalized, or devitalized, 
according to how it’s handled. 


4. French life 

Sometimes, instead of getting our English words directly from 
Latin, we work through one of the Latin-derived or Romance lan¬ 
guages. (As you will recall, the Romance languages—French, 
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian—are so called be¬ 
cause they were originally dialects of the old Roman tongue. Eng¬ 
lish, by the way, is not a Romance language, but a Teutonic one. 
Our tongue is a development of a German dialect imposed on the 
natives of Britain by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes of early Eng¬ 
lish history. Though we have taken over into English more than 
50 per cent of the Latin vocabulary and almost 30 per cent of the 
classical Greek vocabulary as roots and prefixes, our basic lan¬ 
guage is nevertheless German). 

The French, using the same Latin root vivo, to live, formed two 
expressive phrases much used in English. French pronunciation is, 
of course, tricky, and if you are not at least superficially ac¬ 
quainted with that language, your pronunciation may sound a bit 
awkward to the sophisticated ear—but try it anyway. These 
phrases are: 


350 



1. joie ae vivre —pronuuuceu someimng nxe znwana-vimv 
(zh is identical in sound to the s of pleasure ). 

Literally joy of living, this phrase describes an immense delight 
in being alive, an effervescent keenness for all the dally activities 
that human beings indulge in. People who possess joie de vivre are 
never moody, depressed, bored, or apathetic—on the contrary, 
they are full of sparkle, eager to engage in all group activities, and, 
most important, always seem to be having a good time, no matter 
what they are doing. Joie de vivre is precisely the opposite of 
ennui (this is also a word of French origin, but is easy to pro¬ 
nounce: AHN'-wee), which is a feeling of boredom, discontent, 
or weariness resulting sometimes from having a jaded, oversophis¬ 
ticated appetite, sometimes from just finding all of life tedious and 
unappetizing, and sometimes implying in addition physical lassi¬ 
tude and general inactivity. Young children and simple people 
rarely experience ennui —to them life is always exciting, always 
new. 

2. bon vivant, pronounced something like BONG'-vee- 
VAHNG'—the -NG a muted nasal sound similar to the -ng in 
sing. 

A bon vivant is a person who lives luxuriously, especially in re¬ 
spect to rich food, good liquor, expensive theater parties, operas, 
and other accouterments of upper-class life. Bon vivant means, lit¬ 
erally, a good liver; actually, a high liver, one who lives a luxuri¬ 
ous life. When you think of a bon vivant (usually, language being 
sexist, a male), you get the picture of someone attired in top hat, 
“soup and fish” or tuxedo, raising his cane to call a taxi while a 
beautiful, evening-gowned and sophisticated-looking woman, spar¬ 
kling in diamonds and furs, waits at his side. They’re going to a 
champagne and partridge supper at an outrageously expensive res¬ 
taurant, etc.—fill in your own details of the high life. 

The bon vivant is of course a convivial person—and also likely 
to be a gourmet (goor-MAY'), another word from French. 

5. food and how to enjoy it 

The gourmand (GdOR'-nmd) enjoys food with a sensual 
pleasure. To gourmands the high spots of the day are the times for 
breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight supper; in short, they like 


351 



to eat, but the eating must be good. The verb form, gormandize 
(GAWR'-man-dlz'), however, has suffered a degeneration in 
meaning—it signifies to stuff oneself like a pig. 

A gourmand is significantly different from a gourmet , who has 
also a keen interest in food and liquor, but is much more fastidi¬ 
ous, is more of a connoisseur, has a most discerning palate for 
delicate tastes, flavors, and differences; goes in for rare delicacies 
(like hummingbirds’ tongues and other such absurdities); and 
approaches the whole business from a scientific, as well as a sen¬ 
sual, viewpoint. Gourmet is always a complimentary term, gour¬ 
mand somewhat less so. 

The person who eats voraciously, with no discernment what¬ 
ever, but merely for the purpose of stuffing himself (“I know I 
haven’t had enough to eat till I feel sick”), is called a glutton 
(GLUT'-on)—obviously a highly derogatory term. The verb glut¬ 
tonize is stronger than gormandize; the adjective gluttonous. 
(GLUT'-o-nos) is about the strongest epithet you can apply to 
someone whose voracious eating habits you find repulsive. Some¬ 
one who has a voracious, insatiable appetite for money, sex, pun¬ 
ishment, etc. is also called a glutton.

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. no fatigue 

Indefatigable is a derived form of fatigue—in- is a negative 
prefix, the suffix -able means able to be; hence, literally, indefat¬ 
igable means unable to be fatigued. The noun is indefatigability 
(in'-do-fat'-o-go-BIL'-o-tee). 


2. how simple can one be? 

Ingenuous is a complimentary term, though its synonyms naive , 
gullible , and credulous are faintly derogatory. 

To call people ingenuous implies that they are frank, open, art¬ 
less—in other words, not likely to try to put anything over on 
you, nor apt to hide feelings or thoughts that more sophisticated 
persons would consider it wise, tactful, or expedient to conceal. 

Ingenuous should not be confused with ingenious (in-JEEN'- 
yos)—note the slight difference in spelling—which on the con¬ 
trary means shrewd, clever, inventive . 

The noun form of ingenuous is ingenuousness; of ingenious , in¬ 
genuity (in'-j3-N(K)'-3-tee) or ingeniousness. 

To call people naive (nah-EEV') is to imply that they have not 
learned the ways of the world, and are therefore idealistic and 
trusting beyond the point of safety; such idealism and trust have 
probably come from ignorance or inexperience. The noun is 
naivete (nah-eev-TAY'). 

Credulous (KREJ'-a-tes) implies a willingness to believe almost 
anything, no matter how fantastic. Credulity (kro-JdO'-ta-tee), 
like naivete, usually results, again, from ignorance or inexpe¬ 
rience, or perhaps from an inability to believe that human beings 
are capable of lying. 

Gullible (GUL'-o-bal) means easily trickedeasily fooled, eas-

pidity than from ignorance or inexperience. 

These four synonyms, ingenuous, naive, credulous, and gullible, 
are fairly close, but they contain areas of distinction worth 
remembering. Let’s review them: 

1. ingenuous —frank, not given to concealment 

2. naive —inexperienced, unsophisticated, trusting 

3. credulous —willing to believe; not suspicious or skeptical 

4. gullible —easily tricked 


3. belief and disbelief 

Credulous comes from Latin credo, to believe, the same root 
found in credit (if people believe in your honesty, they will, extend 
credit to you; they will credit what you say). -Ous is an adjective 
suffix that usually signifies full of. So, strictly, credulous means full 
of believingness. 

Do not confuse credulous with credible. (KRED'-o-bsl). In the 
latter word we see combined the root credo, believe, with Able, a 
suffix meaning can be. Something credible can be believed. 

Let’s chart some differences: 

Credulous listeners—those who fully believe what they hear 
A credible story—one that can be believed 
An incredulous (in-KREJ'-s-lss) attitude—an attitude of skep¬ 
ticism, of non-belief 

An incredible (in-KRED'-s-bal) story—one that cannot be 
believed 

Incredible characters—persons who are so unique that you can 
scarcely believe they exist. 

Nouns are formed as follows: 

credulous—credulity (krs-J00'-Is-tee) 
incredulous—incredulity (in-krs-J OO'-l 3-tee) 
credible—credibility (kred'-s-B IL'-3-tee) 
incredible—incredibility (in-kred'-3-BIL'-3-tee) 

To check your understanding of these distinctions, try the next 
test. 


359 


Can you use these words correctly? 

Use credulous, credible, or corresponding negative or noun 
forms in the following sentences: 

1. She listened -ly to her hus¬ 

band’s confession of his frequent infidelity, for she had always 
considered him a paragon of moral uprightness. 

2. He told his audience an-and 

fantastic story of his narrow escapes. 

3. He’ll believe you—he’s very- 

4. Make your characters more- 

if you want your readers to believe in them. 

5. We Dstened dumb-struck, full of_, 

to the shocking details of corruption and vice. 

6. He has the most_good luck. 

7. The _ of it! How can such 

things happen? 

8. Naive people accept with complete-, 

whatever anyone tells them. 

9. “Do you believe me?” “Sure—your story is - 

-enough.” 

10. I’m not objecting to the total- 

of your story, but only to your thinking that I’m-— 

-enough to believe it!

5-incredulity, 6-incredible, 7-incredibility, 8-credulity, 
9-credible, 10-incredibility, credulous 


4. what people believe in 

Credo, to believe, is the origin of four other useful English 
words. 


360 





1. Credo (KREE'-do)—personal belief, code of ethics; the 
principles by which people guide their actions. 

2. Creed —a close synonym of credo; in addition, a religious 
belief, such as Catholicism, Judaism, Protestantism, Hinduism, 
etc. 

3. Credence (KREE'-dsns)—belief, as in, “I place no cre¬ 
dence in his stories.” or “Why should I give any credence to what 
you say?” 

4. Credentials (kro-DEN'-shsls)—a document or documents 
proving a person’s right to a title or privilege (i.e., a right to be 
believed), as in, “The new ambassador presented his credentials 
to the State Department.” 

5. heads and tails 

We can hardly close our book on the words suggested by ingen¬ 
uous without looking at the other side of the coin. If ingenuous 
means frank , open, then disingenuous (dis-in-JEN'-yoO-os) should 
mean not frank or open . But disingenuous people are far more 
than simply not ingenuous . They are crafty, cunning, dishonest, 
artful, insincere, untrustworthy—and they are all of these while 
making a pretense of being simple, frank, and aboveboard. You 
are thinking of a wolf in sheep’s clothing? It’s a good analogy. 

Similarly, a remark may be disingenuous, as may also a state¬ 
ment, an attitude, a confession, etc. 

Add -ness to form the noun derived from disingenuous:

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. how to look 

The Latin root specto, to look, is the source of a host of com¬ 
mon English words: spectacle, spectator, inspect, retrospect (a 
looking back), prospect (a looking ahead), etc. In a variant 
spelling, spic-, the root is found in conspicuous (easily seen or 
looked at), perspicacious, and perspicuous . 

A perspicacious (pur'-sps-KAY'-shas) person is keen-minded, 
mentally sharp, astute. Per - is a prefix meaning through; so the 
word etymologically means looking through (matters, etc.) 
keenly, intelligently. The noun:, perspicacity (pur'-spa-KAS'-a- 
tee). Write an alternate noun ending in -ness: 

Perspicacity is a synonym of acumen (a-KY(5D'-man), mental 
keenness, sharpness, quickness; keen insight. The root is Latin 
acuo, to sharpen. 


2. sharpness 

From acuo, to sharpen, come such words as acute, sharp, sud¬ 
den, as acute pain, an acute attack of appendicitis, acute reason¬ 
ing, etc; and acupuncture (AK'-yoo-punk'-char), the insertion of 
a (sharp) needle into the body for medical purposes. The noun 
form of acute, referring to the mind or thinking, is acuteness or 
acuity (a-KYdO-a-tee); in other contexts, acuteness only. 

Acupuncture combines acuo, to sharpen, with punctus, point. 
When you punctuate a sentence, you put various points (periods, 
commas, etc.) where needed; when lightning punctuates the 
storm, or when the silence is punctuated by the wailing of police 


365 



sirens, again points, etymologically speaking, interrupt the atmos¬ 
phere, the quiet, etc. 

If you are punctual, you’re right on the point of time (noun: 
punctuality) ; if you’re punctilious (punk-HL'-ee-ss), you are 
exact, scrupulous, very careful to observe the proper points of be¬ 
havior, procedure, etc. (noun: punctiliousness). And to puncture 
something, of course, is to make a hole in it with a sharp point — 
as to puncture someone’s tire, or figuratively, illusions, fantasies, 
or ego. Pungent (PUN'-jsnt) comes from another form of the 
root punctus (pungo, to pierce sharply), so a pungent smell or 
taste is sharp, spicy, pricking the nose or taste buds, so to speak; 
and a pungent wit sharply pierces one’s sense of humor. Can you 

write the noun forms of this adjective?- 

or_ 


3. some more looking 

Perspicacious should not be confused with perspicuous (por- 
SPIK'-yoo-os). Here is the important distinction: 

Perspicacious means smart, sharp, able to look through and un¬ 
derstand quickly. This adjective applies to persons, their reason¬ 
ing, minds, etc. 

Perspicuous is the obverse side of the coin—it means easily un¬ 
derstood from one look, and applies to writing, style, books, and 
like things that have to be understood. Hence it is a synonym of 
clear, simple, lucid. If you write with perspicuous style, your lan¬ 
guage is clear, easy to understand. If you are perspicacious, you 
understand quickly, easily. 

The noun form of perspicuous is perspicuity (pur'-sps-KYOO'- 
o-tee), or, of course, perspicuousness. 

A spectacle is something to look at; spectacles (eyeglasses) are 
the means by which you get a comfortable and accurate look at 
, the world. Anything spectacular is, etymologically, worth looking 
at. 

A spectator is one who looks at what’s happening. 

To inspect is to look into something. 

Retrospect (RET'-ra-spekt') is a backward look —generally the 
word is preceded by the preposition in, for instance, “His life in 
retrospect seemed dreary and dull,” or “Most experiences seem 


366 



U4V1V V1AJVJUVAV biff f VM U1UU XU UVWWUUVJ Vfr# V J VUVM 

ward). 

Prospect (PROS'-pekt') is a forward look; prospective (pra- 
SPEK'-tiv) is the adjective. What’s the prospect for inflation, for 
world peace, for the domestic energy supply? Your prospective 
mother-in-law is the one you can look forward to if you marry a 
certain person; similarly, your prospective bride, groom, child, 
job, vacation, etc. is the person, thing, or activity in the future that 
you look forward to. (The prefix is pro -, forward, ahead, before.) 

If you enjoy looking at yourself, figuratively speaking, then you 
like to examine your mental processes and emotional reactions, in 
the intense way characteristic of the introvert (see Chapter 3). 
Your mind’s eye turns inward, and you spend a good deal of time 
analyzing yourself, your character, your personality, your actions. 
Hence, since you look inward , you are introspective (in'-tra- 
SPEK'-tiv)—the prefix is intro-, inside, within. If you introspect 
(in'-tra-SPEKT'), you look inward and examine your inner reac¬ 
tions. Too much introspection (in'-tra-SPEK'-shan) or introspec¬ 
tiveness may lead to unhappiness or to depressing thoughts or 
feelings of anxiety—few people have the courage to see them¬ 
selves as they really are. 

There are times when you have to look around most carefully; 
you must then be circumspect (SUR'-kam-spekt')—watchful, 
cautious, alert ( circum -, around). 

The noun is circumspection (sur'-kem-SPEK'-shan) or cir¬ 
cumspectness. 

If something looks good or sensible, but actually is not, we call 
it specious (SPEE'-shas). A specious argument sounds plausible, 
but in reality is based on an error, a fallacy, or an untruth. The 
noun is speciousness.

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. the great and the small 

You are familiar with Latin animus, mind. Animus and a re¬ 
lated root, anima, life principle, soul, spirit (in a sense, these 
meanings are all very similar), are the source of such words as an¬ 
imal, animate and inanimate, animated, and animation; knowing 
the meaning of the roots, you have a better understanding of any 
word built on them. 

Magnanimous contains, in addition to animus, mind, the root 
magnus, large, great, which you recall from magniloquent . Mag¬ 
nanimous people have such great, noble minds or souls that they 
are beyond seeking petty revenge. 

The noun is magnanimity (mag'-na-NIM'-a-tee). 


372 


On the other hand, people who have tiny, tiny minds or souls 
are pusillanimous (pyGO'-so-LAN'-a-mes)—Latin pusillus, tiny. 
Hence, they are contemptibly petty and mean. The noun is 
pusillanimity (pyofc'-so-la-NIM'-a-tee). 

Other words built on animus, mind: 

1. unanimous (yoo-NAN'-a-mos)—of one mind . If the Su¬ 
preme Court hands down a unanimous opinion, all the judges are 
of one mind (Latin unus, one). The noun is unanimity (yoo'-na- 
NIM'-a-tee). 

2. equanimity (ee'-kws-NIM'-s-tee or ek'-wa-NIM'-a-tee)— 
etymologically, “equal (or balanced) mind.” Hence, evenness or 
calmness of mind; composure. If you preserve your equanimity 
under trying circumstances, you keep your temper, you do not get 
confused, you remain calm (Latin aequus, equal). 

3. animus (AN'-o-mss)—hostility, ill will, malevolence. Ety¬ 
mologically, animus is simply mind, but has degenerated, as words 
often do, to mean unfriendly mind . The word is most often used 
in a pattern like, “I bear you no animus, even though you have 
tried to destroy me.” (Such a statement shows real magnanimity /) 

4. animosity (an'-o-MOS'-a-tee)—ill will, hostility. An exact 
synonym of animus, and a more common word. It is used in pat¬ 
terns like, “You feel a good deal of animosity, don’t you?”, 
“There is real animosity between Bill and Emie,’ ? “If you bear me 
no animosity, why do you treat me so badly?” 


2. turning 

Versatile comes from verto, versus, to turn— versatile people 
can turn their hand to many things successfully. The noun is ver¬ 
satility (vur'-sa-TEL'-a-tee). 


3. Zeno and the front porch 

Centuries ago, in ancient Greece, the philosopher Zeno lectured 
on a topic that still piques the human mind, to wit: “How to Live 
a Happy Life.” Zeno would stand on a porch (the Greek word for 
which is stoa) and hold forth somewhat as follows: people should 
free themselves from intense emotion, be unmoved by both joy 


373 



and sorrow, and submit without complaint to unavoidable neces¬ 
sity. 

Today, psychologists suggest pretty much the exact opposite— 
let your emotions flow freely, express your love or animosity, 
don’t bottle up your feelings. But in the fourth century B.c., when 
Zeno was expounding his credo, his philosophy of control of the 
passions fell on receptive ears. His followers were called Stoics, 
after the stoa, or porch, from which the master lectured. 

If we call people stoical , we mean that they bear their pain or 
sorrow without complaint, they meet adversity with unflinching 
fortitude. This sounds very noble, you will admit—actually, ac¬ 
cording to modem psychological belief, it is healthier not to be so 
stoical Stoicism (STO'-a-siz-am) may be an admirable virtue 
(mainly because we do not then have to listen to the stoic's trou¬ 
bles), but it can be overdone. 


4. fear and trembling 

Intrepid is from Latin trepido, to tremble. Intrepid people ex¬ 
hibit courage and fearlessness (and not a single tremble!) when 
confronted by dangers from which you and I would run like the 
cowards we are. (You recognize the negative prefix in-.) 

The noun: intrepidity (in'-tra-PID'-a-tee), or, of course, in¬ 
trepidness. 

Trepido is the source also of trepidation (trep'-a-DAY'-shan) 
—great fear, trembling, or alarm. 


5. quick flash 

Scintilla, in Latin, is a quick, bright spark; in English the word 
scintilla (sin-TIL'-a) may also mean a spark, but more commonly 
refers to a very small particle (which, in a sense, a spark is), as 
in, “There was not a scintilla of evidence against him.” 

In the verb scintillate (SIN'-ta-layt'), the idea of the spark 
remains; someone who scintillates sparkles with charm and wit, 
flashes brightly with humor. The noun is scintillation (sin'-ta 
LAY'-shan). 


374 



6. city and country 

People who live in the big city go to theaters, attend the opera, 
visit museums and picture galleries, browse in bookstores, and 
shop at Robinson’s, Bloomingdale’s, Marshall Field, or other 
large department stores. 

These activities fill them with culture and sophistication. 

Also, they crowd into jammed subway trains or buses, squeeze 
into packed elevators, cross the street in competition with high- 
powered motorcars, patiently stand in line outside of movie 
houses, and then wait again in the lobby for seats to be vacated. 

Also, they have the privilege of spending two hours a day going 
to and coming from work. 

As a result, city-dwellers are refined, polished, courteous—or so 
the etymology of urbane (from Latin urbs, city) tells us. (And 
you must be absurdly credulous, if not downright gullible, to be¬ 
lieve it.) The noun is urbanity (ur-BAN'-s-tee). 

So urbane people are gracious, affable, cultivated, suave, tactful 
—add any similar adjectives you can think of. 

Urban (UR'-bon) as an adjective simply refers to cities— urban 
affairs, urban areas, urban populations, urban life, urban develop¬ 
ment, etc. 

Consider some prefixes: sub-, near; inter-, between; intra-, in¬ 
side, within; ex-, out. 

Add each prefix to the root urbs, using the adjective suffix -an: 

sub_: near the city 

(Sub- has a number of meanings: under, near, close to, 
etc.) 

inter_: between cities 

intra_: within a city 

ex_: out of the city 

The suburbs are residential sections, or small communities, 
close to a large city; Larchmont is a suburb of New York City, 
Whittier a suburb of Los Angeles. 

Suburbia (so-BUR'-bee-a) may designate suburbs as a group; 
suburban residents, or suburbanites (so-BUR'-bo-nlts'), as a 


375 



group; or the typical manners, modes of living, customs, etc. of 
suburban residents. 

An interurban bus travels between cities, an intraurban bus 
within a single city. 

Am exurb (EKS'-urb) lies well beyond, way outside, a large 
city, and generally refers to a region inhabited by well-to-do 
families. Exurb has derived forms corresponding to those of sub¬ 
urb . Can you construct them? 

Plural noun: - 

Adjective: - 

Resident: - 

As a group; manners, customs, etc.: - 

Urbs is the city; Latin rus, ruris is the country, i.e., farmland, 
fields, etc. So rural (RdOR'-ol) refers to country or farm regions, 
agriculture, etc.—a wealthy rural area. 

Rustic (RUS'-tik) as an adjective may describe furniture or 
dwellings made of roughhewn wood, or furnishings suitable to a 
farmhouse; or, when applied to a person, is an antonym of urbane 
—unsophisticated, boorish, lacking in social graces, uncultured. 
Noun: rusticity (rus-TIS'-a-tee). Rustic is also a noun designating 
a person with such characteristics, as in, “He was considered a 
rustic by his classmates, all of whom came from cultured and 
wealthy backgrounds.” 

Urbane and rustic , when applied to people, are emotionally 
charged words. Urbane is complimentary, rustic derogatory.* 

To rusticate (RUS'-to-kayt') is to spend time in the country, 
away from the turmoil and tensions of big-city life. Can you con¬ 
struct the noun?_ 

* Incidentally, a word used with a derogatory connotation (bitch, piggish, 
glutton , idiot, etc.) is called a pejorative (pe-JAWR'-a-tiv). Pejorative is 
also an adjective, as in, “She spoke in pejorative terms about her ex-hus- 
band.” The derivation is Latin pejor, worse.

WORDS INFLUENCE YOUR THINKING 

By now, you have thoroughly explored hundreds upon hun¬ 
dreds of valuable words and scores upon scores of important 
Greek and Latin roots. 

As you went along you stopped at frequent intervals to say 
aloud, think about, work with, and recall the words you were add¬ 
ing to your vocabulary. 

By now, therefore, the words you have been learning are proba¬ 
bly old friends of yours; they have started to influence your think¬ 
ing, have perhaps begun to appear in your conversation, and have 
certainly become conspicuous in your reading. In short, they have 
been effective in making changes in your intellectual climate. 

Let us pause now for another checkup of the success of your 
study. In the next chapter, you will find a second Comprehensive 
Test. Take the test cold if you feel that all the material is at your 
fingertips; or spend a little time reviewing Chapters 9, 10, 11, and 
12 if you believe such review is necessary.

SESSION 39 


This world, Robert Louis Stevenson once claimed—with, I think, 
questionable logic—is so full of a number of things that we should 
all be as happy as kings. 

I doubt very strongly that happiness comes from the outside, or 
that kings are necessarily happy. But I will go this far (and no 
further) with Stevenson: the world is certainly full of a number of 
things. For instance, poverty and misery, hospitals and insane asy¬ 
lums, slums and racial restrictions, cut-down forests and once fer¬ 
tile lands becoming progressively more arid, war and death and 
taxes and bumbling diplomats. I know that Stevenson had a 
different sort of thing in mind, for romantic poets tend to view the 
world through rose-tinted spectacles, but it is often necessary to 
counter one extreme with another—and I simply wish to set the 
record straight. 

In this chapter we are going to discuss a number of things to be 
found in the world and in the minds of its inhabitants—poverty 
and wealth; secondhand emotions; the relativity of time; praise of 
various sorts; small talk and how to indulge in it; animals; long¬ 
ings for the past; sounds; eating habits; and many kinds and con¬ 
ditions of secrecy. 

As you see, when you start exploring ideas, as we constantly do 
in these chapters, you never know what will turn up. 


IDEAS 


1. for want of the green stuff 

There are those people who are forced (often through no fault 
of their own) to pursue an existence not only devoid of such luxu¬ 
ries as radios, television sets, sunken bathtubs, electric orange- 
juice squeezers, automobiles, Jacuzzis, private swimming pools, 


402 



etc., out lacKing also in many ot the pure necessities oi living— 
sufficient, food, heated homes, hot water, vermin- and rodent-free 
surroundings, decent clothing, etc. 

Such people live: 

in penury 


2. at least watch it 

All normal people want and need love and at least a modicum 
of excitement in their lives—so say the psychologists. If no one 
loves them, and if they can find no one on whom to lavish their 
own love, they may often satisfy their emotional longings and 
needs by getting their feelings secondhand—through reading love 
stories, attending motion pictures, watching soap operas, etc. 

These are: 

vicarious feelings 


3. time is fleeting 

During the late winter and early spring of 1948-49, great num¬ 
bers of people went practically berserk joining and forming “pyra¬ 
mid clubs.” If you have not heard of this amazing phenomenon, I 
won’t attempt to describe it in any of its multifarious ramifica¬ 
tions, but the main point was that you paid two dollars, treated 
some people to coffee and doughnuts, and shortly thereafter (if 
you were gullible enough to fall for this get-rich-quick scheme) 
supposedly received a return of some fantastic amount like $2,064 
for your investment. 

For a short time, pyramid clubs were a rage—soon they had 
vanished from the American scene. 

Anything that lasts for but a short time and leaves no trace is: 

ephemeral 


4. how not to call a spade ... 

Words are only symbols of things—they are not the things 
themselves. (This, by the way, is one of the basic tenets of seman- 


403 


tics.) But many people identify the word and the thing so closely 
that they fear to use certain words that symbolize things that are 
unpleasant to them. 

I know that this is confusing, so let me illustrate. 

Words having to do with death, sex, certain portions of the 
anatomy, excretion, etc. are avoided by certain people. 

These people prefer circumlocutions—words that “talk around” 
an idea or that mean or imply something but don’t come right out 


and say so directly. 


For example: 


WORD 

CIRCUMLOCUTION 

die 

expire; depart this life; pass away; 
leave this vale of tears 

sexual intercourse 

(intimate) relations; “playing house”; 
“shacking up” 

prostitute 

lady of the evening; fille de foie; 
painted woman; lady of easy virtue; 
fille de nuit; streetwalker; hooker 

house of prostitution 

house of ill-fame; bawdyhouse; 
house of ill-repute; bagnio; brothel; 
bordello; “house”; “massage parlor” 

buttocks, behind 

derriere; rear end; butt; tail 

breasts 

bosom; bust; curves 

toilet 

powder room; little girl’s room; 
facilities; washroom; lavatory; head 

The left-hand column is the direct, non-pussyfooting word. The 

right-hand column is made up of: 


euphemisms 


5. small talk 

“Whenever I’m in the dumps, I get a new suit.” 

“Oh, so that’s where you get them!” 

“Lend me a dime—I want to phone one of my friends.” 
“Here’s a quarter—call them all.” 

“The doctor says I have snoo in my blood!” 


404 



anoo: wnars snoo r 
“Not a darn! What’s new with you?” 

“What are twins?” 

“Okay, what are twins?” 

“Womb mates!” 

“I took a twip yesterday.” 

“A twip?” 

“Yes, I took a twip on a twain!” 

These are examples of: 

badinage 


6. everything but give milk 

You’ve seen a cow contentedly munching its cud. Nothing 
seems capable of disturbing this animal—and the animal seems to 
want nothing more out of life than to lead a simple, vegetable ex¬ 
istence. 

Some people are like a cow—calm, patient, placid, phlegmatic, 
vegetable-like. They are: 

' bovine* 


7. good old days 

Do you sometimes experience a keen, almost physical, longing 
for associations or places of the past? 

When you pass the neighborhood in which you were born and 
where you spent your early years, do you have a sharp, strange re¬ 
action, almost akin to mild nausea? 

When you are away from home and friends and family, do 
pleasant remembrances crowd in on your mind to the point where 
your present loneliness becomes almost unbearable, and you actu¬ 
ally feel a little sick? 

This common feeling is called: 

nostalgia 

* Remember Ogden Nash’s delightful definition? 

The cow is of the bovine ilk, 

One end moo, the other end milk. 


405 



8. sounds that grate 

Some sounds are so harsh, grating, and discordant that they 
offend the ear. They lack all sweetness, harmony, pleasantness. 
Traffic noises of a big city, electronic rock music, chalk squeaking 
on a blackboard. ... 

Such blaring, ear-splitting, or spine-tingling sounds are called: 

cacophonous 


9. eating habits 

Lions, tigers, wolves, and some other mammals subsist entirely 
on flesh. No spinach, salad greens, whole-wheat cereals, sugar, or 
spices—just good, red meat. 

These mammals are: 


carnivorous 


10. private and public 

There are certain things most of us do in private, like taking a 
bath. Some people like to engage in other activities in complete 
privacy—eating, reading, watching TV, sleeping, for example. 

The point is that, while these activities may be conducted in pri¬ 
vacy, there is never any reason for keeping them secret. 

But there are other activities that are kept not only private, but 
well-shrouded in secrecy and concealed from public knowledge. 
These activities are unethical, illegal, or unsafe—like having an 
affair with someone whose spouse is your best friend, betraying 
military secrets to die enemy, trading in narcotics, bribing public 
officials, etc. 

Arrangements, activities, or meetings that fall under this cate¬ 
gory are called: 

clandestine

SESSION 40 

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1. money, and what it will buy 

The modern world operates largely by means of a price struc¬ 
ture—wealth and poverty are therefore words that indicate the 


409 




possession, on the one hand, or the lack, on the other, of money. 
Penury, from Latin penuria, need, neediness, is dire, abject pov¬ 
erty, complete lack of financial resources. It is one of the two 
strongest English words there are to denote absence of money. 
The adjective form, penurious (pa-NYdOr'-ee-ss or ps-NdOR' 
ee-ss), strangely enough, may mean poverty-stricken, but more 
commonly signifies stingy, close-fisted, niggardly; so sparing in the 
use of money as to give the appearance of penury. 

Penurious is a synonym of parsimonious (pahr'-sa-MO'-nee- 
as), but is much stronger in implication. A parsimonious person is 
stingy; a penurious person is twice as stingy. Penury, then, is pov- 
erty; penuriousness is stinginess, excessive frugality. The noun 
form of parsimonious is parsimony (PAHR'-sa-mo'-nee). 

A somewhat milder word than penury for poverty (if you can 
imagine a mild degree of poverty) is indigence (IN'-do-jans). In¬ 
digent (IN'-ds-jont) people are not absolutely penniless—they are 
simply living in reduced circumstances, forgoing many creature 
comforts, forced to undergo the type of hardships that may ac¬ 
company a lack of sufficient funds. 

On the other hand, a close synonym of penury, and one of 
equal strength, is destitution (des'-ta-TOO'-shan). Destitute 
(DES'-ta-t<55t) people do not even have the means for mere 
subsistence—as such, they are perhaps on the verge of starvation. 
Penury and destitution are not merely straitened circum¬ 
stances—they are downright desperate circumstances. 

To turn now to the brighter side of the picture, the possession 
of money, especially in increasing amounts, is expressed by 
affluence (AF'-lOD-ans). Affluent (AF'-l<5D-ant) people, people 
of affluence, or those living in affluent circumstances, are more 
than comfortable; in addition, there is the implication that their 
wealth is increasing. People who live in affluence probably own 
large and costly homes, run big, new cars, belong to expensive 
golf or country clubs, etc. 

A much stronger term is opulence (OP'-ys-lans), which not 
only implies much greater wealth than affluence, but in addition 
suggests lavish expenditures and ostentatiously luxurious sur¬ 
roundings. People of opulence own estates; drive only outra¬ 
geously expensive and specially equipped cars (Rolls-Royces, 
Mercedes-Benzes, Porsches, etc.); have a corps of servants, in- 


410 



eluding a major-domo; belong to golf and yacht and country 
clubs, etc., etc. Embroider the fantasy as much as you wish to. 
Opulent (OP'-yo-bnt) may describe people, surroundings, styles 
of life, or the like. 

A ffluent is a combination of the prefix ad-, to, toward (chang¬ 
ing to af - before a root beginning with /), plus the Latin verb fluo, 
to flow— affluence is that delightful condition in which money 
keeps flowing to us, and no one ever turns off the spigot. Other 
words from the same root, fluo, to flow, are fluid, influence, 
confluence (a “flowing together”), fluent (the words flow 
smoothly), etc. 

Opulent is from Latin opulentus, wealthy. No other English 
words derive from this root. 


2. doing and feeling 

If you watch a furious athletic event, and you get tired, though 
the athletes expend all the energy—that’s vicarious fatigue. 

If your friend goes on a bender, and as you watch him absorb 
one drink after another, you begin to feel giddy and stimulated, 
that’s vicarious intoxication. 

If you watch a mother in a motion picture or dramatic play 
suffer horribly at the death of her child, and you go through the 
same agony, that’s vicarious torment. 

You can experience an emotion, then, in two ways: firsthand, 
through actual participation; or vicariously, by becoming em- 
pathetically involved in another person’s feelings. 

Some people, for example, lead essentially dull and colorless 
lives. Through their children, through reading or attending the 
theater, however, they can experience all the emotions felt by 
others whose lives move along at a swift, exciting pace. These 
people live at second hand; they live vicariously . 


3. time is relative 

Elephants and turtles live almost forever; human beings in the 
United States have a life expectancy in general of sixty-eight to 
seventy-six years (though the gradual conquest of disease is con- 


411 



stantly lengthening our span);t dogs live from seven to ten years; 
and some insects exist for only a few hours or days. 

One such short-lived creature is the dayfly, which in Greek was 
called ephemera. Hence anything so short-lived, so unenduring 
that it scarcely seems to outlast the day, may be called ephemeral. 

A synonym of ephemeral is evanescent (ev-a-NES'-ant), fleet¬ 
ing, staying for a remarkably short time, vanishing. Something 
intangible, like a feeling, may be called evanescent; it's here, and 
before you can quite comprehend it, it’s gone—vanished. 

The noun is evanescence (ev'-a-NES'-ans); the verb is to 
evanesce (ev-a-NES'). 

Evanescent is built on the prefix e- (ex-), out, the root vanesco, 
to vanish, and the adjective suffix - ent . 

The suffix -esce often, but not always, means begin to. -Escent 
may mean becoming or beginning to. Thus: 

adolescent —beginning to grow up; 

beginning to become an adult 
evanesce —begin to vanish 
convalesce —begin to get well after illness 
putrescent —beginning to rot; 

beginning to become putrid 
obsolescent —becoming obsolete 


4. an exploration of various good things 

A euphemism is a word or expression that has been substituted 
for another that is likely to offend—it is built on the Greek prefix 
eu-, good, the root pheme, voice, and the noun suffix -ism. (Etymo¬ 
logically, “something said in a good voice!”) Adjective: eu¬ 
phemistic (y<5&'-fa-MIS'-tik) 

Other English words constructed from the prefix eu-: 

1. euphony (YOO'-fa-nee)—good sound; pleasant lilt or 
rhythm (phone, sound) 

Adjective: euphonic (ydb-FON'-ik) or euphonious (yoO-FO'- 
nee-as) 

t Latest figures, 1978, for the United States: males, 68.5 years; females, 
76.4 years. 


412 



2. eulogy (YOO'-b-jee)—etymologically, “good speech”; a 
formal speech of praise, usually delivered as a funeral oration. 
Logos in this term means word or speech , as it did in philology 
(Chapter 6). Logos more commonly means science or study , but 
has the alternate meaning in eulogy, philology , monologue , dia¬ 
logue, epilogue (words upon the other words, or “after-words”), 
and prologue (words before the main part, “before-words,” or 
introduction). 

Adjective: eulogistic (y<5o-b-JIS'-tik); verb: eulogize (YOO-b- 
jlz'); person who delivers a eulogy: eulogist (YOO-b-jist) 

3. euphoria (y<5o-FAWR'-ee-9)—good feeling, a sense of men¬ 
tal buoyancy and physical well-being 

Adjective: euphoric (yOO-FAWR'-ik) 

4. euthanasia (yoo'-ths-NAY'-zha) —etymologically, “good 
death”; method of painless death inflicted on people suffering 
from incurable diseases—not legal at the present time, but ad¬ 
vocated by many people. The word derives from eu - plus Greek 
thanatos, death. 


5. exploration of modes of expression 

Badinage is a half-teasing, non-malicious, frivolous banter, in¬ 
tended to amuse rather than wound. Badinage has a close syno¬ 
nym, persiflage (PUR'-sa-flahzh'), which is a little more derisive, 
a trifle more indicative of contempt or mockery—but still totally 
unmalicious. 

In line with badinage and persiflage, there are four other forms 
of expression you should be familiar with: cliche (klee-SHAY'), 
bromide (BR6'-mId')> platitude (PLAT'-o-tObd), and anodyne 
(AN'-g-dln'). 

A cliche is a pattern of words which was once new and fresh, 
but which now is so old, worn, and threadbare that only banal, 
unimaginative speakers and writers ever use it. Examples are: fast 
and furious; unsung heroes; by leaps and bounds; conspicuous by 
its absence; green with envy; etc. The most devastating criticism 
you can make of a piece of writing is to say, “It is full of clichis”; 
the most pointed insult to a person’s way of talking is, “You speak 
in clichis” 


413 



ururmue la any uuc, uun, auu piuuauiy lanaciuus lciuain 

that shows little evidence of original thinking, and that therefore 
convinces a listener of the total absence of perspicacity on the part 
of the speaker. 

For instance, some cautious, dull-minded individual might warn 
you not to take a chance in these words: “Remember it’s better to 
be safe than sorry!” 

Your sneering response might be: “Oh, that old bromide!” 

A platitude is similar to a cliche or bromide , in that it is a dull, 
trite, hackneyed, unimaginative pattern of words—but, to add in¬ 
sult to injury ( cliche ), the speaker uses it with an air of novelty— 
as if he just made it up, and isn’t he the brilliant fellow! 

An anodyne, in the medical sense, is a drug that allays pain 
without curing an illhess, like aspirin or morphine. Figuratively, 
an anodyne is a statement made to allay someone’s fears or anxie¬ 
ties, not believed by the speaker, but intended to be believed by 
the listener. “Prosperity is just around the comer” was a popular 
anodyne of the 1930s. 

A bromide is also a drug, formerly used as a sedative. Sedatives 
dull the senses—the statement labeled a bromide comes from a 
speaker of dull wit and has a sedative effect on the listener. The 
adjective is bromidic (bro-MID'-ik), as in “his bromidic way of 
expressing himself.” 

Platitude derives from Greek platys, broad or flat, plus the noun 
suffix - tude . Words like plateau (flat land), plate and platter 
(flat dishes), and platypus (flat foot) all derive from the same 
root as platitude , a flat statement, i.e., one that falls flat, despite 
the speaker’s high hopes for it. The adjective is platitudinous 
(plat'-a-TOO-da-nas), as in, “What a platitudinous remark.” 

Anodyne is a combination of the negative prefix an - with Greek 
odyne, pain. Anodynes , as drugs, lessen pain; as statements, they 
are intended to reduce or eliminate emotional pain or anxiety.

SESSION 41 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. people are the craziest animals 

Bovine , placid like a cow, stolid, patient, unexcitable, is built on 
the Latin word for ox or cow, bovis, plus the suffix -ine, like, simi¬ 
lar to, or characteristic of. To call someone bovine is of course far 
from complimentary, for this adjective is considerably stronger 
than phlegmatic, and implies a certain mild contempt on the part 
of the speaker. A bovine person is somewhat like a vegetable: eats 
and grows and lives, but apparently is lacking in any strong feel¬ 
ings. 

Humans are sometimes compared to animals, as in the follow¬ 
ing adjectives: 

1. leonine (LEE'-o-nln')—like a lion in appearance or temper¬ 
ament. 

2. canine (KAY'-nln')—like a dog. As a noun, the word refers 
to the species to which dogs belong. Our canine teeth are similar 
to those of a dog. 


421 




3. feline (FEE'-Iln')—catlike. We may speak of feline grace; 
or (insultingly) of feline temperament when we mean that a per¬ 
son is “catty.” 

4. porcine (PAWR'-sIn')—piglike. 

5. vulpine (VUL'-pin')—foxlike in appearance or tempera¬ 
ment. When applied to people, this adjective usually indicates the 
shrewdness of a fox. 

6. ursine (UR'-sIn')—bearlike. 

7. lupine (LOO'-pm)—wolflike. 

8. equine (EE'-kwIn')—horselike; “horsy.” 

9. piscine (PIS'-In')—fishlike. 

All these adjectives come from the corresponding Latin words 
for the animals; and, of course, each adjective also describes, or 
refers to, the specific animal as well as to the person likened to the 
animal. 


1. leo 

lion 

2. canis 

dog 

3. felis 

cat 

4. porcus 

Pig 

5. vulpus 

fox 

6. ursus 

bear 

7. lupus 

wolf 

8. equus 

horse 

9. piscis 

fish 


The word for meat from a pig— pork —derives, obviously, from 
porcus . Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the Great Bear and the Lit¬ 
tle Bear, the two conspicuous groups of stars in the northern sky 
(conspicuous, of course, only on a clear night), are so labeled be¬ 
cause in formation they resemble the outlines of bears. The femi¬ 
nine name Ursula is, by etymology, “a little bear,” which, perhaps, 
is a strange name to burden a child with. The skin disease lupus 
was so named because it eats into the flesh, as a wolf might. 

2. you can't go home again 

Nostalgia, built on two Greek roots, nostos, a return, and algos, 
pain (as in neuralgia, cardialgia, etc.), is a feeling you can’t ever 


422 



unaerstana until you ve experiencea it—ana you nave prooaoiy 
experienced it whenever some external stimulus has crowded your 
mind with scenes from an earlier day. 

You know how life often seems much pleasanter in retrospect? 
Your conscious memory tends to store up the pleasant experiences 
of the past (the trauma and unpleasant experiences may get 
buried in the unconscious), and when you are lonely or unhappy 
you may begin to relive these pleasant occurrences. It is then that 
you feel the emotional pain and longing that we call nostalgia . 

The adjective is nostalgic (nos-TAL'-jik), as in “motion pic¬ 
tures that are nostalgic of the fifties,” or as in, “He feels nostalgic 
whenever he passes 138th Street and sees the house in which he 
grew up.” 

3. soundings 

Cacophony is itself a harsh-sounding word—and is the only one 
that exactly describes the unmusical, grating, ear-offending noises 
you are likely to hear in man-made surroundings: the New York 
subway trains thundering through their tunnels (they are also, 
these days in the late 1970s, eye-offending, for which we might 
coin the term cacopsis, noun, and cacoptic, adjective), the traffic 
bedlam of rush hours in a big city, a steel mill, an automobile fac¬ 
tory, a blast furnace, etc. Adjective: cacophonous (ko-KOF'-s- 
nas). 

These words are built on the Greek roots kakos , bad, harsh, or 
ugly, and phone , sound. 

Phone , sound, is found also in: 

1. telephone —etymologically, “sound from afar” 

2. euphony — pleasant sound 

3. phonograph —etymologically, “writer of sound” 

4. saxophone —a musical instrument (hence sound) invented 
by Adolphe Sax 

5. xylophone —a musical instrument; etymologically, “sounds 
through wood” (Greek xylon, wood) 

6. phonetics (fo-NET'-iks)—the science of the sounds of lan¬ 
guage; the adjective is phonetic (fe-NET'-ik), the expert a phone¬ 
tician (fo'-no-TISH'-an) 


423 



7. phonics —the science of sound; also the method of teaching 
reading by drilling the sounds of letters and syllables 


4. the flesh and all 

Carnivorous combines carnis, flesh, and voro , to devour. A car¬ 
nivorous animal, or carnivore (KAHR'-na-vawr'), is one whose 
main diet is meat. 

Voro , to devour, is the origin of other words referring to eating 
habits: 

1. herbivorous (hur-BIV'-ar-as)—subsisting on grains, grasses, 
and other vegetation, as cows, deer, horses, etc. The animal is a 
herbivore (HUR'-ba-vawr'). Derivation: Latin herba, herb, plus 
voro , to devour 

2. omnivorous (om-NIV'-ar-as)—eating everything: meat, 
grains, grasses, fish, insects, and anything else digestible. The only 
species so indiscriminate in their diet are humans and rats, plus, of 
course, some cats and dogs that live with people (in contrast to 
felines and canines —lions, tigers, bobcats, wolves, etc.—that are 
not domesticated). Omnivorous (combining Latin omnis, all, with 
voro , plus the adjective suffix -ous) refers not only to food. An 
omnivorous reader reads everything in great quantities (that is, 
devours all kinds of reading matter). 

3. voracious (vaw-RAY'-shas)— devouring; hence, greedy or 

gluttonous; may refer either to food or to any other habits. One 
may be a voracious eater, voracious reader, voracious in one’s 
pursuit of money, pleasure, etc. Think of the two noun forms of 
loquacious . Can you write two nouns derived from voracious? 
( 1 )-, ( 2 )- 


5. “allness” 

Latin omnis , all, is the origin of: 

1. omnipotent (om-NIP'-a-tant)—all-powerful, an adjective 
usually applied to God; also, to any ruler whose governing powers 
are unlimited, which allows for some exaggeration, as King 
Canute the Great proved to his sycophantic courtiers when he or- 


424 



dered the tide to come so far up the beach and no further. He got 
soaking wet! ( Omnis plus Latin potens, potentis , powerful, as in 
potentate , a powerful ruler; impotent (IM'-pa-tant), powerless; 
potent , powerful; and potential, possessing power or ability not 
yet exercised). Can you write the noun form of omnipotent? 


2. omniscient (om-NISH'-ant)—all-knowing: hence, infinitely 

wise. ( Omnis plus sciens , knowing.) We have discussed this adjec¬ 
tive in a previous chapter, so you will have no problem writing the 
noun: -_ 

3. omnipresent (om'-na-PREZ'-ant)—present in all places at 
once. Fear was omnipresent in Europe during 1939 just before 
World War II. A synonym of omnipresent is ubiquitous (yoo- 
BIK'-wa-tas), from Latin ubique, everywhere. The ubiquitous ice 
cream vendor seems to be everywhere at the same time, tinkling 
those little bells, once spring arrives. The ubiquitous little red 
wagon rides around everywhere in airports to refuel departing 
planes. u Ubiquitous laughter greeted the press secretary’s re¬ 
mark,” i.e., laughter was heard everywhere in the room. The noun 

forms are ubiquity (yoo-BIK'-wa-tee) or - 

-- (Can you think of the alternate form?) 

4. omnibus (OM'-na-bas)—etymologically, “for all, including 
all.” In the shortened form bus we have a public vehicle for all 
who can pay; in a John Galsworthy omnibus we have a book con¬ 
taining all of Galsworthy’s works; in an omnibus legislative bill we 
have a bill containing all the miscellaneous provisions and appro¬ 
priations left out of other bills. 


6. more flesh 

Note how carnis, flesh, is the building block of: 

1. carnelian (kahr-NEEL'-yan)—a reddish color, the color of 
red flesh. 

2. carnival (KAHR'-na-val)—originally the season of merry¬ 
making just before Lent, when people took a last fling before say¬ 
ing “Come vo/e/” “Oh flesh, farewell!” (Latin vo/e, farewell, 
goodbye). Today a carnival is a kind of outdoor entertainment 


425 



with games, rides, side shows, and, of course, lots of food—also 
any exuberant or riotous merrymaking or festivities. 

3. carnal (KAHR'-nal)—most often found in phrases like 
“carnal pleasures” or “carnal appetites,” and signifying pleasures 
or appetites of the flesh rather than of the spirit—hence, sensual, 
lecherous, lascivious, lubricious, etc. The noun is carnality (kahr- 
NAL'-a-tee). 

4. carnage (KAHR'-naj)—great destruction of life (that is, of 
human flesh), as in war or mass murders. 

5. reincarnation (ree'-in-kahr-NAY'-shan)—a rebirth or reap¬ 
pearance. Believers in reincarnation maintain that one’s soul per¬ 
sists after it has fled the flesh, and eventually reappears in the 
body of a newborn infant or animal, or in another form. Some of 
us, according to this interesting philosophy, were once Napoleon, 
Alexander the Great, Cleopatra, etc. The verb is to reincarnate 
(ree-in-KAHR'-nayt), to bring (a soul) back in another bodily 
form. 

6. incarnate (in-KAHR'-nat)—in the flesh. If we use this adjec¬ 
tive to call someone “the devil incarnate ” we mean that here is 
the devil in the flesh. Or we may say that someone is evil incar¬ 
nate, that is, the personification of evil, evil invested with human 
or bodily form. The verb to incarnate (in-KAHR'-nayt) is to em¬ 
body, give bodily form to, or make real. 


7. dark secrets 

Clandestine comes from Latin clam, secretly, and implies se¬ 
crecy or concealment in the working out of a plan that is danger¬ 
ous or illegal. Clandestine is a close synonym of surreptitious 
(sur'-ap-TISH'-as), which means stealthy, sneaky, furtive, gener¬ 
ally because of fear of detection. 

The two words cannot always, however, be used interchange¬ 
ably. We may speak of either clandestine or surreptitious meetings 
or arrangements; but usually only of clandestine plans and only 
of surreptitious movements or actions. Can you write the noun 
form of surreptitious? -

TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST 

1. American poet William Cullen Bryant wrote a poem in 1811 
called Thanatopsis. You are familiar with both roots in the word. 
Can you figure out the meaning?_ _~ _ 


2. If you wanted to coin a word for the study or science of 
death and dying, what would you come up with? 


3. Pheme, as you know from euphemism , means voice. This 
root derives from a Greek verb phanai, to speak, which, as it trav- 


437 






eled through Latin, Old French, and Middle English, finally took 
on the spelling phet -, phec-, or phes-. And you recall that the 
Greek prefix pro- means beforehand or ahead (as in prognosis , 
prologue , etc.). Can you now combine elements to form a word 
meaning: 

(a) to say beforehand; to foretell (an occurrence before 

it actually happens)?_ 

(b) the foretelling of such an occurrence? - 


(c) the person who foretells?_ 

4. Can you combine a Latin prefix and root to form words of 
the same meaning? 

(a) to foretell:_ 

(b) the act of foretelling: _.. 

5. An eminent psychoanalyst, Richard Karpe of Connecticut, 

has coined the term nostopathy (nos-TOP / -3-thee) for an emo¬ 
tional disorder he diagnosed among a number of his patients who 
were returning veterans of World War II and of the Korean and 
Vietnam wars. You know both roots in the word. Can you figure 
out the meaning? __ 


6. Coin a word that means: 

(a) the killing of foxes:_ 

(b) the killing of wolves:_ 

(c) the killing of lions, tigers, and other cats:_ 

(d) the killing of bears:- 

7. Figure out an adjective that means: 

(a) fish-eating:__ 

(b) insect-eating:_ 

8. Have you ever wondered whether the Canary Islands were 

named after the Latin root canis, dog? They were. Large, wild 
dogs isha&ited die area. Pretty songbirds also abounded there. 
What were these birds called?_

GETTING USED TO NEW WORDS 

Reference has been made, in previous chapters, to the intimate 
relationship between reading and vocabulary building. Good books 
and the better magazines will not only acquaint you with a host of 
new ideas (and, therefore, new words, since every word is the 
verbalization of an idea), but also will help you gain a more com¬ 
plete and a richer understanding of the hundreds of words you are 
learning through your work in this book. If you have been doing a 
sufficient amount of stimulating reading—and that means, at mini¬ 
mum, several magazines a week and at least three books of non¬ 
fiction a month—you have been meeting, constantly, over and 
over again, the new words you have been learning in these pages. 
Every such encounter is like seeing an old friend in a new place. 
You know how much better you understand your friends when 
you have a chance to see them react to new situations; similarly, 
you will gain a much deeper understanding of the friends you 
have been making among words as you see them in different con¬ 
texts and in different places. 

My recommendations in the past have been of non-fiction titles, 
but novels too are a rich source of additions to your vocabu¬ 
lary—provided you stay alert to the new words you will inevitably 
meet in reading novels. 

The natural temptation, when you encounter a brand-new word 
in a novel, is to ignore it—the lines of the plot are perfectly clear 
even if many of the author’s words are not. 

I want to counsel strongly that you resist the temptation to ig¬ 
nore the unfamiliar words you may meet in your novel reading: 
resist it with every ounce of your energy, for only by such resist¬ 
ance can you keep building your vocabulary as you read. 

What should you do? Don’t rush to a dictionary, don’t bother 
underlining the word, don’t keep long lists of words that you will 
eventually look up en masse —these activities are likely to become 


439 


painful and you will not continue them for any great length of 
time. 

Instead, do something quite simple—and very effective. 

When you meet a new word, underline it with a mental pencil. 
That is, pause for a second and attempt to figure out its meaning 
from its use in the sentence or from its etymological root or prefix, 
if it contains one you have studied. Make a mental note of it, say 
it aloud once or twice—and then go on reading. 

That’s all there is to it. What you are doing, of course, is 
developing the same type of mind-set toward the new word that 
you have developed toward the words you have studied in this 
book. And the results, of course, will be the same—you will begin 
to notice the word occurring again and again in other reading you 
do, and finally, having seen it in a number of varying contexts, 
you will begin to get enough of its connotation and flavor to come 
to a fairly accurate understanding of its meaning. In this way you 
will be developing alertness not only to the words you have stud¬ 
ied in this book, but to all expressive and meaningful words. And 
your vocabulary will keep growing. 

But of course that will happen only if you keep reading . 

I do not wish to recommend any particular novels or novelists, 
since the type of fiction one enjoys is a very personal matter. You 
doubtless know the kind of story you like—mystery, science 
fiction, spy, adventure, historical, political, romantic. Western, bi¬ 
ographical, one or all of the above. Or you may be entranced by 
novels of ideas, of sexual prowess, of fantasy, of life in different 
segments of society from your own. No matter. Find the kind of 
novel or novelist you enjoy by browsing in the public library or 
among the thousands of titles in bookstores that have a rich as¬ 
sortment of paperbacks as well as hardbacks. 

And then read! And keep on the alert for new words! You will 
find them by the hundreds and thousands. Bear in mind: people 
with rich vocabularies have been reading omnivorously , vora¬ 
ciously, since childhood —including the ingredients listed in small 
print on bread wrappers and cereal boxes.

-Brief Intermission Eight- 


HOW TO SPELL A WORD 


The spelling of English words is archaic, it’s confusing, it’s need¬ 
lessly complicated, and, if you have a sense of humor, it’s down¬ 
right comical. In fact, any insulting epithet you might wish to level 
against our weird methods of putting letters together to form 
words would probably be justified—but it’s our spelling, and we’re 
stuck with it. 

How completely stuck we are is illustrated by a somewhat ludi¬ 
crous event that goes back to 1906, and that cost philanthropist 
Andrew Carnegie $75,000. 

Working under a five-year grant of funds from Carnegie, and 
headed by the esteemed scholar Brander Matthews, the Simplified 
Spelling Board published in that year a number of recom¬ 
mendations for bringing some small semblance of order out of the 
great chaos of English spelling. Their suggestions affected a mere 
three hundred words out of the half million then in the language. 
Here are a few examples, to give you a general idea: 


SPELLING THEN CURRENT

doubt 

debtor

though

laf 

tough 

tuf

nife 

theatre

centre

These revisions seemed eminently sensible to no less a per¬ 
sonage than the then President of the United States, Theodore 
Roosevelt. So delighted was he with the new garb in which these 
three hundred words could be clothed that he immediately or¬ 
dered that all government documents be printed in simplified 
spelling. And the result? Such a howl went up from the good citi¬ 
zens of the republic, from the nation’s editors and schoolteachers 
and businessmen, that the issue was finally debated in the halls of 
Congress. Almost to a man, senators and representatives stood 
opposed to the plan. Teddy Roosevelt, as you have doubtless 
heard, was a stubborn fellow—but when Congress threatened to 
hold up the White House stationery appropriation unless the Pres¬ 
ident backed down, Teddy rescinded the order. Roosevelt ran for 
re-election some time later, and lost. That his attitude toward 
spelling contributed to his defeat is of course highly doubtful— 
nevertheless an opposition New York newspaper, the day the re¬ 
turns were in, maliciously commented on the outgoing incumbent 
in a one-word simplified-spelling editorial: “THRU!” 

Roosevelt was not the first President to be justifiably outraged 
by our ridiculous orthography. Over a hundred years ago, when 
Andrew Jackson was twitted on his poor spelling, he is supposed 
to have made this characteristic reply, “Well, sir, it is a damned 
poor mind that cannot think of more than one way to spell a 
word!” And according to one apocryphal version, it was Jackson’s 
odd spelling that gave birth to the expression “okay.” Jackson 
thought, so goes the story, that “all correct” was spelled “orl kor- 
rect,” and he used O.K. as the abbreviation for these words when 
he approved state papers. 

Many years ago, the British playwright George Bernard Shaw 
offered a dramatic proposal for reducing England’s taxes. Just 


442 



eliminate unnecessary letters from our unwieldy spelling, he said, 
and you’ll save enough money in paper and printing to cut every¬ 
one’s tax rate in half. Maybe it would work, but it’s never been 
put to the test—and the way things look now, it never will be. 
Current practice more and more holds spelling exactly where it is, 
bad though it may be. It is a scientific law of language that if 
enough people make a “mistake,” the “mistake” becomes accepta¬ 
ble usage. That law applies to pronunciation, to grammar, to word 
meanings, but not to spelling. Maybe it’s because of our misbe¬ 
gotten faith in, and worship of, the printed word—maybe it’s be¬ 
cause written language tends to be static, while spoken language 
constantly changes. Whatever the cause, spelling today success¬ 
fully resists every logical effort at reform. “English spelling,” said 
Thorstein Veblen, “satisfies all the requirements of the canons of 
reputability under the law of conspicuous waste. It is archaic, 
cumbrous, and ineffective.” Perfectly true. Notwithstanding, it’s 
here to stay. 

Your most erudite friend doubtless misspells the name of the 
Hawaiian guitar. I asked half a dozen members of the English de¬ 
partment of a large college to spell the word—without exception 
they responded with ukelele. Yet the only accepted form is 
ukulele . 

Judging from my experience with my classes at Rio Hondo Col¬ 
lege, half the population of the country must think the word is 
spelled alright. Seventy-five per cent of the members of my classes 
can’t spell embarrassing or coolly. People will go on misspelling 
these four words, but the authorized spellings will remain impervi¬ 
ous to change. 

Well, you know the one about Mohammed and the mountain. 
Though it’s true that we have modernized spelling to a micro¬ 
scopic extent in the last eighty years ( traveler, center, theater, me¬ 
dieval, labor, and honor, for example, have pretty much replaced 
traveller, centre, theatre, mediaeval, labour, and honour), still the 
resistance to change has not observably weakened. If spelling 
won’t change, as it probably won’t, those of us who consider our¬ 
selves poor spellers will have to. We’ll just have to get up and go 
to the mountain. 

Is it hard to become a good speller? I have demonstrated over 
and over again in my classes that anyone of normal intelligence 



and average educational background can become a good speller in 
very little time. 

What makes the task so easy? 

First—investigations have proved that 95 per cent of the 
spelling errors that educated people make occur in just one hun¬ 
dred words. Not only do we all misspell the same words—but we 
misspell them in about the same way. 

Second—correct spelling relies exclusively on memory, and the 
most effective way to train memory is by means of association or, 
to use the technical term, mnemonics. 

If you fancy yourself an imperfect or even a terrible speller, the 
chances are very great that you’ve developed a complex solely be¬ 
cause you misspell some or all of the hundred words with which 
this Intermission deals. When you have conquered this single list, 
and I shall immediately proceed to demonstrate how easy it is, by 
means of mnemonics, to do so, 95 per cent of your spelling 
difficulties will in all likelihood vanish. 

Let us start with twenty-five words from the list. In the first col¬ 
umn you will find the correct spelling of each, and in the second 
column the simple mnemonic that will forevermore fix that correct 
spelling in your memory. 


CORRECT SPELLING MNEMONIC 

1. all right Two words, no matter what it means. 

Keep in mind that it’s the opposite of 
all wrong. 

2. coolly Of course you can spell cool —simply 

add the adverbial ending -ly. 

3. supersede This is the only word in the language 

ending in -sede (the only one, mind 
you—there isn’t a single other one so 
spelled). 

4. succeed The only three words in the entire 

5. proceed language ending in -ceed. When you 

6. exceed think of the three words in the order 

given here, the initial letters form the 
beginning of SPEED. 


444 



7. cede, precede, 
recede, etc. 

8. procedure 

9. stationery 

10. stationary 

11. recommend 

12. separate 

13. comparative 

14. ecstasy 

15. analyze 

16. paralyze 

17. repetition 

18. irritable 

19. inimitable 

20. absence 

21. superintendent 

22. conscience 

23. anoint 

24. ridiculous 

25. despair 


All other words with a similar-sound¬ 
ing final syllable end in - cede . 

One of the double e’s of proceed 
moves to the end in the noun form, 
procedure . 

This is the word that means paper, 
and notice the - er in paper . 

In this spelling, the words means 
standing, and notice the - a in stand. 
Commend , which we all spell 
correctly, plus the prefix re-. 

Look for a rat in both words. 

to sy (sigh) with ecstasy 
The only two non-technical words in 
the whole language ending in -yze. 
First four letters identical with those 
in the allied form repeat . 

Think of allied forms irritate and 
imitate . 

Think of the allied form absent, and 
you will not be tempted to misspell 
it abscence . 

The superintendent in an apartment 
house collects the rent —thus you 
avoid superintendant. 

Science plus prefix con-. 

Think of an ointment, hence no 
double n. 

Think of the allied form ridicule, 
which we usually spell correctly, thus 
avoiding rediculous. 

Again, think of another form— 
desperate—and so avoid d/spair. 


Whether or not you have much faith in your spelling ability, 
you will need very little time to conquer the preceding twenty-five 


445 



demons. Spend a few minutes, now, on each of those words in the 
list that you’re doubtful of, and then test your success by means of 
the exercise below. Perhaps to your astonishment, you will find it 
easy to make a high score. 


A test of your learning 

Instructions: After studying the preceding list of words, fill in 
the missing letters correctly. 

1. a_right 

2. coo_y 

3. super_ 

4. sue_ 

5. pro_ 

6. ex_ 

7. pre- 

8. proc_dure 

9. station_ry (paper) 

10. station-ry (still) 

11. sep_rate 

12. compar_tive 

13. re-o-end 

Mere repetitious drill is of no value in learning to spell a word 
correctly. You’ve probably heard the one about the youngster who 
was kept after school because he was in the habit of using the 
ungrammatical expression “I have went.” Miss X was going to 
cure her pupil, even if it required drastic measures. So she ordered 
him to write “I have gone” one thousand times. “Just leave your 
work on my desk before you go home,” she said, “and I’ll find it 
when I come in tomorrow morning.” Well, there were twenty 
pages of neat script on her desk next morning, one thousand lines 
of “I have gone’s,” and on the last sheet was a note from the 
child. “Dear Teacher,” it read, “I have done the work and I have 
went home.” If this didn’t actually happen, it logically could have, 
for in any drill, if the mind is not actively engaged, no learning 
will result. If you drive a car, or sew, or do any familiar and repe¬ 
titious manual work, you know how your hands can carry on an 


14. ecsta_y 

15. anal_e 

16. paral-e 

17. rep_tition 

18. irrit_ble 

19. inimit_ble 

20. ab_ence 

21. superintend-nt 

22. con_nee 

23. a-oint 

24. r_diculous 

25. d-spair 


446 



accustomed task while your mind is far away. And if you hope to 
learn to spell by filling pages with a word, stop wasting your time. 
All you’ll get for your trouble is writer’s cramp. 

The only way to learn to spell those words that now plague you 
is to devise a mnemonic for each one . 

If you are never quite sure whether it’s indispensible or indis¬ 
pensable, you can spell it out one hundred, one thousand, or one 
million times—and the next time you have occasion to write it in 
a sentence, you’ll still wonder whether to end it with - ible or - able . 
But if you say to yourself just once that able people are generally 
indispensable, that thought will come to you whenever you need 
to spell the word; in a few seconds you’ve conquered another 
spelling demon. By engineering your own mnemonic through a 
study of the architecture of a troublesome word, you will become 
so quickly and completely involved with the correct spelling of 
that word that it will be impossible for you ever to be stumped 
again. 

Let us start at once. Below you will find another twenty-five 
words from the list of one hundred demons, each offered to you in 
both the correct form and in the popular misspelling. Go through 
the test quickly, checking off what you consider a proper choice in 
each case. In that way you will discover which of the twenty-five 
you would be likely to get caught on. Then devise a personal 
mnemonic for each word you flunked, writing your ingenious re¬ 
sult out in the margin of the page. And don’t be alarmed if some 
of your mnemonics turn out kind of silly—the sillier they are 
the more likely you are to recall them in an emergency. One of my 
pupils, who could not remember how many Vs to put into tran¬ 
quillity (or is it tranquility ?), shifted his mind into high gear and 
came up with this: “In the old days life was more tranquil than 
today, and people wrote with quills instead of fountain pens. 
Hence— tranquillity /” Another pupil, a girl who always chewed 
her nails over irresistible before she could decide whether to end 
it with -ible or -able, suddenly realized that a certain brand of 
lipstick was called irresistible, the point being of course that the 
only vowel in lipstick is i —hence, -ible! Silly, aren’t they? But 
they work. Go ahead to the test now; and see how clever—or 
silly—you can be.

By now you’re well on the way toward developing a definite su¬

thing, for I’ve learned, working with my students, that many peo-

pie trunk tney re awtui spellers, ana nave completely lost iaitn in 
their ability, solely because they get befuddled over no more than 
two dozen or so common words that they use over and over again 
and always misspell. Every other word they spell perfectly, but 
they still think they’re prize boobs in spelling until their self- 
confidence is restored. So if you’re beginning to gain more assur¬ 
ance, you’re on the right track. The conquest of the one hundred 
common words most frequently misspelled is not going to assure 
you that you will always come out top man in a spelling bee, but 
it’s certain to clean up your writing and bolster your ego. 

So far you have worked with fifty of the one hundred spelling 
demons. Here, now, is the remainder of the list. Test yourself, or 
have someone who can keep a secret test you, and discover which 
ones are your Waterloo. Study each one you miss as if it were a

mind. 

Happy spelling!

HOW TO TALK 
ABOUT WHAT GOES ON 

(Sessions 42-44 ) 


TEASER PREVIEW 

What verb, ending in -ate, means: 

• to exhaust? 

• to scold severely? 

• to deny oneself? 

• to repeat the main points? ^ 

• to be a victim of mental or intellectual stagnation? 

• to pretend? 

• to hint? 

• to make (something ) easier to bear? 

• to show sympathy? 

• to waver indecisively? 



SESSION 42 


WORDS are symbols of ideas—and we have been learning, 
discussing, and working with words as they revolve around certain 
basic concepts. 

Starting with an idea (personality types, doctors, occupations, 
science, lying, actions, speech, insults, compliments, etc.), we 
have explored the meanings and uses of ten basic words; then, 
working from each word, we have wandered off toward any ideas 
and additional words that a basic word might suggest, or toward 
any other words built on the same Latin or Greek roots. 

By this natural and logical method, you have been able to make 
meaningful and lasting contact with fifty to a hundred or more 
words in each chapter. And you have discovered, I think, that 
while five isolated words may be difficult to learn in one day, fifty 
to a hundred or more related words are easy to learn in a few ses¬ 
sions. 

In this session we learn words that tell what’s going on, what’s 
happening, what people do to each other or to themselves, or 
what others do to them. 


IDEAS. 


1. complete exhaustion 

You have stayed up all night. And what were you doing? Play¬ 
ing poker, a very pleasant way of whiling away time? No. Engag¬ 
ing in some creative activity, like writing a short story, planning a 
political campaign, discussing fascinating questions with friends? 
No. 

The examples I have offered are exciting or stimulating—as 
psychologists have discovered, it is not work or effort that causes 
fatigue, but boredom, frustration, or a similar feeling. 


452 



You have stayed up all night with a very sick husband, wife, 
child, or dear friend. And despite all your ministrations, the pa¬ 
tient is sinking. You can see how this long vigil contains all the el¬ 
ements of frustration that contribute to mental, physical, and 
nervous fatigue. 

And so you are bushed—but completely bushed. Your exhaus¬ 
tion is mental, it is physiological, it is emotional. 

What verb expresses the effect of the night’s frustrations on 
you? 

to enervate 


2. tongue-lashing 

You suddenly see the flashing red light as you glance in your 
rear-view mirror. It’s the middle of the night, yet the police flasher 
is clear as day—and then you hear the low growl of the siren. So 
you pull over, knowing you were speeding along at 70 on the 55- 
mile-an-hour-limit freeway—after all, there was not another car in 
sight on the deserted stretch of road you were traveling. 

The cop is pleasant, courteous, smiling; merely asks for your 
driver’s license and registration; even says “Please.” 

Feeling guilty and stupid, you become irritated. So what do you 
do? 

You lash out at the officer with all the verbal vituperation 
welling up in you from your self-anger. You scold him harshly for 
not spending his time looking for violent criminals instead of har¬ 
assing innocent motorists; you call into question his honesty, his 
ambition, his fairness, even his ancestry. To no avail, of course— 
you stare at the traffic ticket morosely as the police cruiser pulls 
away. 

What verb describes how you reacted? 

to castigate 


3. altruistic 

Phyllis is selfless and self-sacrificing. Her husband’s needs and 
desires come first—even when they conflict with her own. Clothes 
for her two daughters are her main concern—even if she has to 


453 



wear a seven-year-old coat and outmoded dresses so that Paula 
and Evelyn can look smart and trim. At the dinner table, she 
heaps everyone’s plate—while she herself often goes without. 
Phyllis will deny herself, will scrimp and save—all to the end that 
she may offer her husband and children the luxuries that her low 
self-esteem does not permit her to give herself. 

What verb expresses what Phyllis does? 

to self-abnegate 


4. repetition 

You have delivered a long, complicated lecture to your class, 
and now, to make sure that they will remember the important 
points, you restate the key ideas, the main thoughts. You offer, in 
short, a kind of brief summary, step by step, omitting all extrane¬ 
ous details. 

What verb best describes what you do? 

to recapitulate 


5. no joie de vivre 

Perhaps you wake up some gloomy Monday morning (why is it 
that Monday is always the worst day of the week?) and begin to 
think of the waste of the last five years. Intellectually, there has 
been no progress—you’ve read scarcely half a dozen books, 
haven’t made one new, exciting friend, haven’t had a startling or 
unusual thought. Economically, things are no better—same old 
debts to meet, same old hundred dollars in the bank, same old 
job, same old routine of the eight-to-five workdays, the tuna fish 
or chicken salad sandwich for lunch, the same dreary ride home. 
What a life! No change, nothing but routine, sameness, monotony 
—and for what? (By now you’d better get up—this type of think¬ 
ing never leads anywhere, as you’ve long since learned.) 

What verb describes how you think you live? 

to vegetate 
454 



6. pretense 

Your neighbor, Mrs. Brown, pops in without invitation to tell 
you of her latest troubles with (a) her therapist, (b) her 
hairdresser, (c) her husband, (d) her children, and/or (e) her 
gynecologist. 

Since Florence Brown is dull to the point of ennui, and anyway 
you have a desk piled high with work you were planning to light 
into, you find it difficult to concentrate on what she is saying. 
However, you do not wish to offend her by sending her packing, 
or even by appearing to be uninterested, so you pretend rapt at¬ 
tention, nodding wisely at what you hope are the right places. 

What verb describes this feigning of interest? 

to simulate 


7. slight hint, no more 

You are an author and are discussing with your editor the pos¬ 
sible avenues of publicity and advertising for your new book. At 
one point in the conversation the editor makes several statements 
which might—or might not—be construed to mean that the com¬ 
pany is going to promote the book heavily. For example, “If we 
put some real money behind this, we might sell a few copies,” or 
“I wonder if it would be a good idea to get you on a few talk 
shows . . No unequivocal commitments, no clear-cut promises, 
only the slight and oblique mention of possibilities. 

What verb expresses what the editor is doing? 

to intimate 


8. helpful 

Aspirin doesn’t cure any diseases. Yet this popular and inex¬ 
pensive drug is universally used to lighten and relieve various un¬ 
pleasant symptoms of disease: aches and pains, fever, inflamma¬ 
tions, etc. 

What verb expresses the action of aspirin?

9. when the bell tolls 


John Donne’s lines (made famous by Ernest Hemingway): 

No man is an Hand, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece 
of the Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod bee washed 
away i?y the Sea, Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promon- 
torie were , as well as if a Mannor of thy friends or of thine 
owne were; any mans death diminishes me, because I am in¬ 
volved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know for 
whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee. 

are truer than you may think; any person who views another’s 
pain with complete detachment or indifference is shutting off im¬ 
portant feelings. 

When people have suffered a bereavement (as through death); 
when they have been wounded by life or by friends; then is the 
time they most need to feel that they are not alone, that you share 
their misery with them even if you cannot directly alleviate their 
sorrow. Your sympathy and compassion are, of course, alleviation 
enough. 

What verb signifies this vicarious sharing of sorrow with some¬ 
one who directly suffers? 

to commiserate 


10. when two men propose 

Should you marry John or George? (You’re strongly and 
equally attracted to both.) John is handsome, virile, tender; 
George is stable, reliable, dependable, always there when you 
need him. George loves you deeply; John is more exciting. You 
decide on John, naturally. 

But wait—marrying John would mean giving up George, and 
with George you always know where you stand; he’s like the Rock 
of Gibraltar (and sometimes almost as dull). So you change your 
mind—it’s George, on more mature reflection. 

But how happy can you be with a husband who is not exciting? 
Maybe John would be best after all. . . .

me penauium swings oacK ana rorm—you cannot maxe up 
your mind and stick to it. (You fail to realize that your indecision 
proves that you don’t want to marry either one, or perhaps don’t 
want to give either one up, or possibly don’t even want to get mar¬ 
ried.) First it’s John, then it’s George, then back to John, then 
George again. Which is it, which is it? 

What verb describes your pendulum-like indecision? 

to vacillate

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. more than fatigue 

When you are enervated, you feel as if your nerves have been 
ripped out—or so the etymology of the word indicates. 

Enervate is derived from e - (ex-), out, and Latin nervus, iierve. 
Enervation (en'-or-VAY'-shsn) is not just fatigue, but complete 
devitalization—physical, emotional, mental—as if every ounce of 
the life force has been sapped out, as if the last particle of energy 
has been drained away. 

Despite its similar appearance to the word energy, enervation is 
almost a direct antonym. Energy is derived from the Greek prefix 
en-, in, plus the root ergon, work; erg is the term used in physics 
for a unit of work or energy. Synergism (SIN'-or-jiz-am)—the 
prefix syn-, together or with, plus ergon —is the process by which 
two or more substances or drugs, by working together, produce a 
greater effect in combination than the sura total of their individual 
effects. 

Alcohol, for example, is a depressant. So are barbiturates and 
other soporifics. Alcohol and barbiturates work synergistically 
(sin'-ar-JIS'-tikMee)—the effect of each is increased by the other 
if the two are taken together. 

So if you’re drinking, don’t take a sleeping pill—or if you must 
take a pill for your insomnia, don’t drink—the combination, if not 
lethal, will do more to you than you may want done! 

Synergy (SIN'-sr-jee), by the way, is an alternate form of 
synergism . 

2. verbal punishment 

Castigate is derived from a Latin verb meaning to punish; in 
present-day usage, the verb generally refers to verbal punishment, 


460 



usually harsh and severe. It is somewhat synonymous with scold, 
criticize, rebuke, censure, reprimand, or berate, but much stronger 
than any of these —rail at, rant at, slash at, lash out at, or tongue- 
lash is a much closer synonym. When candidates for office cas¬ 
tigate their opponents, they do not mince words. 

Can you construct the noun form of castigate? __ 


3. saying “No!" to oneself 

Abnegate is derived from Latin ab-, away (as in absent ), plus 
nego, to deny— self-abnegation (ab'-no-GAY'-shon), then, is self- 
denial. Nego itself is a contraction of Latin neg-, not, no, and aio, 
I say; to be self-abnegating is to say “No!” to what you want, as if 
some inner censor were at work whispering, “No, you can’t have 
that, you can’t do that, you don’t deserve that, you’re not good 
enough for that. . . .” 

To negate (no-GAYT') is to deny the truth or existence of, as 
in “The atheist negates God”; or, by extension, to destroy by 
working against, as in, “His indulgence in expensive hobbies 
negate s all his wife’s attempts to keep the family solvent.” Can 
you write the noun form of the verb negate? -- 

Negative and negativity obviously spring from the same source 
as negate . 


4. heads and headings 

Latin caput, capitis means head. The captain is the head of any 
group; the capital is the (< head city” of a state or nation; and to 
decapitate (dee-KAP'-s-tayt') is to chop off someone’s head, a 
popular activity during the French Revolution after the guillotine 
was invented. Write the noun form of decapitate: _ 

Latin capitulum is a little head, or, by extension, the heading, or 
title, of a chapter. So when you recapitulate, you go through the 
chapter headings again (re-), etymologically speaking, or you 
summarize or review the main points. 

Remembering how the noun and adjective forms are derived 

461 



from adulate (Chapter 9), can you write the required forms of re¬ 
capitulate? 

noun: --— 

adjective: --- 

When you capitulate (ko-PICH'-a-layt'), etymologically you 
arrange in headings, or, as the meaning of the verb naturally 
evolved, you arrange conditions of surrender, as when an army 
capitulates to the enemy forces under prearranged conditions; or, 
by further natural extension, you stop resisting and give up, as in, 
“He realized there was no longer any point in resisting her ad¬ 
vances, so he reluctantly capitulated ” Can you write the noun 
form of capitulate? _ 


5. mere vegetables 

Vegetable is from Latin vegeto, to live and grow, which is what 
vegetables do—but that’s all they do, so to vegetate , is, by impli¬ 
cation, to do no more than stay alive, stuck in a rut, leading an 
inactive, unstimulating, emotionally and intellectually stagnant 
existence. Vegetation (vej'-o-TAY'-shan) is any dull, passive, stag¬ 
nant existence; also any plant life, as the thick vegetation of a 
jungle.

SESSION 44 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1. not the real McCoy 

Simulate is from Latin simulo, to copy; and simulo itself derives 
from the Latin adjectives similis , like or similar. 

Simulation (sim'-yo-LAY'-shan), then, is copying the real 
thing, pretending to be the genuine article by taking on a similar 
appearance. The simulation of joy is quite a feat when you really 
feel depressed. 

Genuine pearls grow inside oysters; simulated pearls are syn¬ 
thetic, but look like the ones from oysters. (Rub a pearl against 
your teeth to tell the difference—the natural pearl feels gritty.) So 
the frequent advertisement of an inexpensive necklace made of 
“genuine simulated pearls” can fool you if you don’t know the 
word—you’re being offered a genuine fake* 

Dissimulation (ds-sim'-yg-LAY'-shsn) is something else! When 
you dissimulate (da-SIM'-yg-layt'), you hide your true feelings 
by making a pretense of opposite feelings. (Then again, maybe 
it’s not something completely else!) 

Sycophants are great dissimulators —they may feel contempt, 

465 





out snow admiration; they may teel negative, but express abso¬ 
lutely positive agreement. 

A close synonym of dissimulate is dissemble (da-SEM'-bal), 
which also is to hide true feelings by pretending the opposite; or, 
additionally, to conceal facts, or one’s true intentions, by decep¬ 
tion; or, still further additionally, to pretend ignorance of facts 
you’d rather not admit, when, indeed, you’re fully aware of them. 

The noun is dissemblance (da-SEM'-blans). 

In dissimulate and dissemble, the negative prefix dis- acts 
largely to make both words pejorative. 


2. hints and helps 

The verb intimate is from Latin intimus, innermost, the same 
root from which the adjective intimate (IN'-to-mot) and its noun 
intimacy (IN'-ta-ma-see) are derived; but the relationship is only 
in etymology, not in meaning. An intimation (in'-ta-MAY'-shan) 
contains a significance buried deep in the innermost core, only a 
hint showing. As you grow older, you begin to have intimations 
that you are mortal; when someone aims a .45 at you, or when a 
truck comes roaring down at you as you drive absent-mindedly 
against a red light through an intersection, you are suddenly very 
sure that you are mortal. 

Alleviate is a combination of Latin levis, light (not heavy), the 
prefix ad-, to, and the verb suffix. {Ad- changes to al- before a 
root starting with/-.) 

If something alleviates your pain, it makes your pain lighter for 
you; if I alleviate your sadness, I make it lighter to bear; and if 
you need some alleviation (s-lee'-vee-AY'-shan) of your prob¬ 
lems, you need them made lighter and less burdensome. To allevi¬ 
ate is to relieve only temporarily, not to cure or do away with. 
{Relieve is also from levis, plus re-, again—to make light or easy 
again.) The adjective form of alleviate is alleviative (o-LEE'-vee- 
ay'-tiv)—aspirin is an alleviative drug. 

Anything light will rise—so from the prefix e- {ex-), out, plus 
levis, we can construct the verb elevate, etymologically, to raise 
out, or, actually, raise up, as to elevate one’s spirits, raise them up, 
make them lighter; or elevate someone to a higher position, which 
is what an elevator does. 


466 


nave you ever seen a performance of magic in which a person 
or an object apparently rises in the air as if floating? That’s levita¬ 
tion (lev'-a-TAY'-shan)—rising through no visible means. (I’ve 
watched it a dozen times and never could figure it out!) The verb, 
to so rise, is levitate (LEV'-o-tayt'). 

And how about levity (LEV'-a-tee)? That’s lightness too, but 
of a different sort—lightness in the sense of frivolity, flippancy, 
joking, or lack of seriousness, especially when solemnity, dignity, 
or formality is required or more appropriate, as in “tones of lev¬ 
ity” or as in, “Levity is out of place at a funeral, in a house of 
worship, at the swearing-in ceremonies of a President or Supreme 
Court Justice,” or as in, “Okay, enough levity —now let’s get 
down to business!” 


3. sharing someone’s misery 

Latin miser , wretched, the prefix con- (which, as you know, be¬ 
comes com- before a root beginning with m-), together or with, 
and the verb suffix -ate are the building blocks from which com¬ 
miserate is constructed. “I commiserate with you,” then, means, 
“I am wretched together with you—I share your misery.” The 

noun form?- 

Miser, miserly , miserable , misery all come from the same root. 


4. swing and sway 

Vacillate —note the single c, double /—derives from Latin 
vacillo, to swing back and forth. The noun form?-- 

People who swing back and forth in indecision, who are irreso¬ 
lute, who can, unfortunately, see both, or even three or four, sides 
of every question, and so have difficulty making up their minds, 
are vacillatory (VAS'-a-la-tawr'-ee). They are also, usually, am¬ 
bivalent (am-BIV'-a-tent)—they have conflicting and simulta¬ 
neous emotions about the same person or thing; or they want to 
go but they also want to stay; or they love something, but they 
hate it too. The noun is ambivalence (am-BIV'-o-fens)—from 
ambi both. (Remember ambivert and ambidextrous from Chap¬ 
ter 3?) 


467 



Ambivalence has best been defined (perhaps by Henny Young- 
man—if he didn’t say it first, he should have) as watching your 
mother-in-law drive over a cliff in your new Cadillac. 

To vacillate is to swing mentally or emotionally. To sway back 
and forth physically is oscillate —again note the double Z—(OS'- 
3-1 ayt'), from Latin oscillum, a swing. A pendulum oscillates , the 
arm of a metronome oscillates, and people who’ve had much too 
much to drink oscillate when they try to walk. The noun?-

TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST 

We have previously met the Greek prefix syn-, together or with, 
in synonym (“names together”) and sympathy (“feeling with”), 
and again in this chapter in synergism (“working together”). 

Syn- is a most useful prefix to know. Like Latin con-, (together 
or with) and ad- (to, toward), the final letter changes depending 
on the first letter of the root to which it is attached. Syn- becomes 
sym- before b, m, and p. 

Can you construct some words using syn-, or sym-? 

1. Etymologically, Jews are “led together” in a house of wor¬ 

ship ( agogos, leading). Can you construct the word for this tem¬ 
ple or place of worship?_’_ 

2. There is a process by which dissimilar organisms live to¬ 
gether (bios, life) in close association, each in some way helping, 
and getting help from, the other (like the shark and the pilot 
fish). What word, ending in -sis, designates such a process? 

What would the adjective form be?_ 

3. Using Greek phone, sound, write the word that etymo¬ 
logically refers to a musical composition in which the sounds 

of all instruments are in harmony together- 

-Using the suffix -ic, write the adjective form of this 

word:_ 

4. Combine sym- with metron, measurement, to construct a 

word designating similarity of shape on both sides (i.e., “measure¬ 
ment together”):_ 

Write the adjective form of this word: _ 


5. Syn- plus dromos, a running, are the building blocks of a 
medical word designating a group of symptoms that occur (i.e., 
run) together in certain diseases. Can you figure out the word? 


6. The same dromos, a running, combines with Greek hippos, 
horse, to form a word referring to a place in ancient Greece in 


473 




which horse and chariot races were run. The word? 


7. Hippos, horse, plus Greek potamos, river, combine to form a 
word designating one of the three pachyderms we discussed in an 
earlier chapter. The word?__

PICKING YOUR FRIENDS’ BRAINS 

You can build your vocabulary, I have said, by increasing your 
familiarity with new ideas and by becoming alert to the new words 
you meet in your reading of magazines and books. 

There is still another productive method, one that will be partic¬ 
ularly applicable in view of all the new words you are learning 
from your study of these pages. 

That method is picking your friends* brains. 

Intelligent people are interested in words because words are 
symbols of ideas, and the person with an alert mind is always in¬ 
terested in ideas. 

You may be amazed, if you have never tried it, to find that you 
can stir up an animated discussion by asking, in a social group 

that you attend, “What does __ 

mean?” (Use any word that particularly fascinates you.) Someone 
in the group is likely to know, and almost everyone will be willing 
to make a guess. From that point on, others in the group will ask 
questions about their own favorite words (most people do have 
favorites), or about words that they themselves have in some 
manner recently learned. As the discussion continues along these 
lines, you will be introduced to new words yourself, and if your 
friends have fairly good vocabularies you may strike a rich vein of 
pay dirt and come away with a large number of words to add to 
your vocabulary. 

This method of picking your friends’ brains is particularly fruit¬ 
ful because you will be learning not from a page of print (as in 
this book or as in your other reading) but from real live persons 
—the same sources that children use to increase their vocab- 


474 



ularies at such prodigious rates. No learning is quite as effective as 
the learning that comes from other people—no information in 
print can ever be as vivid as information that comes from another 
human being. And so the words you pick up from your friends 
will have an amazingly strong appeal, will make a lasting impres¬ 
sion on your mind. 

Needless to say, your own rich vocabulary, now that you have 
come this far in die book, will make it possible for you to contrib¬ 
ute to your friends’ vocabulary as much as, if not more than, you 
take away—but since giving to others is one of the greatest 
sources of a feeling of self-worth, you can hardly complain about 
this extra dividend.

-Brief Intermission Nine- 


TAKE THIS SPELLING TEST 


Even in the most painstakingly edited of magazines, a silly little 
misspelling of a perfectly common word will occasionally appear. 
How the error eluded the collective and watchful eyes of the edi¬ 
tor, the associate editor, the assistant editor, the typesetter, and 
the proofreader, no one will ever know—for practically every 
reader of the magazine spots it at once and writes an indignant 
letter, beginning: “Didn’t you ever go to school. . . ?” 

Even if you went to school, you’re going to have plenty of trou¬ 
ble spotting the one misspelled word in each group below. And 
not one of these words will be a demon like sphygmomanometer 
(a device for measuring blood pressure) or piccalilli (a highly 
seasoned relish), which no one would ever dare spell without first 
checking with a dictionary. On the contrary, every word will be of 
the common or garden variety that you might use every day in 
your social or business correspondence. 

Nevertheless, you’re letting yourself in for ten minutes of real 
trouble, for you will be working with fifty particularly difficult 
spelling words. So put on your thinking cap before you begin. 

A half-dozen high school teachers who took this test were able 
to make an average score of only five proper choices. Can you do 
better? Six or seven right is very good , eight or nine right is excel¬ 
lent, and 100 per cent success marks you as an absolute expert in 
English spelling.

SESSION 45 


There are thousands of English words that end in the letters - ous 
—a Latin suffix meaning full of. 

The central theme about which the words in this chapter revolve 
is the idea of “fullness”—and as you will shortly see, you can be 
full of compliance and servility; full of complaints; full of snob¬ 
bery; full of noise; full of no money; full of horsemanship; full of 
harmlessness; full of liquor; full of deathly pallor; and full of sor¬ 
rows. 

For each of these ideas English has a word—and the person with 
a rich vocabularly knows the exact word to describe what someone 
is full of. 


IDEAS 


1. compliance 

The Latin root sequor means to follow —and those who follow 
rather than lead are usually in a menial, subordinate, or inferior 
position. People who engage in certain fields of endeavor— 
waiters, clerks, and servants, for example—are forced, often con¬ 
trary to their natural temperaments, to act excessively courteous, 
pleasant, obliging, even subservient and humble. They must follow 
the lead of their customers or employers, bending their own wills 
according to the desires of those they serve. They are, etymologi¬ 
cally, full of following after, or— 

obsequious 

RELATED WORDS! 

1. obsequies —In a funeral cortege, the mourners follow after 
the corpse. Hence, obsequies are the burial ceremonies, the funeral 
rites. 


479 



2. subsequent —A subsequent letter, paragraph, time, etc. is one 
that follows another. 

3. sequel —A sequel may be a literary work, such as a novel, 
that follows another, continuing the same subject, dealing with 
the same people or village, etc. or it may be an occurrence that 
grows out of or follows another, as in, “Just wait until you hear 
the sequel to the story!” 

4. sequence —In order, one item following another, as in, “The 
sequence of events of the next few days left him breathless.” 

Any other word containing the root sequ- is likely to have some 
relationship to the idea of following . 


2. complaints 

The Latin root queror means to complain —and anyone full of 
complaints, constantly nagging, harping, fretful, petulant, whin¬ 
ing, never satisfied, may accordingly be called— 

querulous 


3. snobbery 

The Latin root cilium means eyelid; super means above; and 
above the eyelid, as anyone can plainly see, is the eyebrow. Now 
there are certain obnoxious people who go around raising their 
eyebrows in contempt, disdain, and sneering arrogance at ordi¬ 
nary mortals like you and me. Such contemptuous, sneering, over¬ 
bearingly conceited people are called— 

supercilious 


4. noise 

The Latin root strepo means to make a noise. Anyone who is 
unruly, boisterous, resistant to authority, unmanageable—and in 
a noisy, troublesome manner—is 

obstreperous 

480 



5. moneyless 

The Latin root pecus means cattle —and at one time in human 
history a person’s wealth was measured not by stocks and bonds 
but by stocks of domestic animals, which was a lot more logical, 
since you get milk and leather and meat from cattle—true wealth 
—and all you get from the stock market is a headache. 

Someone who had lots of pecus , then, was rich—someone 
without pecus was indigent, destitute, “broke.” And so today we 
call someone who is habitually without funds, who seems generally 
to be full of a complete lack of money— 

impecunious 

This word is not a synonym of indigent , destitute , or poverty- 
stricken; it does not necessarily imply living in reduced circum¬ 
stances or want, but quite simply being short of cash—habitually. 

RELATED WORD: 

1. pecuniary —pertaining to money, as in, a pecuniary consid¬ 
eration, pecuniary affairs, etc. 

6. horses 

The French word cheval means horse; and in medieval times 
only gentlemen and knights rode on horses—common people 
walked. Traditionally (but not, I understand, actually) knights 
were courteous to women, attentive to female desires, and self- 
sacrificing when their own interests came in conflict with those 
of the fair sex. Hence, we call a modem man who has a knightly 
attitude to women— 


chivalrous 


RELATED WORDS: 

(Cheval , horse, comes from Latin caballus, an inferior horse. 
Callabus is found in English words in the spelling caval-.) 

1. cavalcade —A procession of persons on horseback, as in a 
parade. 

2. cavalier —As a noun, a cavalier was once a mounted soldier. 

481 



As an adjective, cavalier describes actions and attitudes that are 
haughty, unmindful of others’ feelings, too offhand, such attributes 
often being associated with people in power (the military being 
one of the powers-that-be). Thus, “He answered in a cavalier man¬ 
ner” would signify that he was arrogant in his answer, as if the 
questioner were taking a little too much privilege with him. Or, 
“After the cavalier treatment I received, I never wished to return,” 
signifying that I was pretty much made to feel unimportant and 
inferior. Or, “After her cavalier refusal, I’ll never invite her to 
another party,” signifying that the refusal was, perhaps, curt, off¬ 
hand, without any attempt at apology or courtesy. 

3. cavalry —The mounted, or “horsed” part of an army. 

4. chivalry —Noun form of chivalrous. Can you write the alter¬ 
nate noun form ending in -ness? ___ 

5. chivalric —Less commonly used adjective form, identical in 
meaning to chivalrous. 

Another Latin root for horse , as you know, is equus, found in 
words we have already discussed: 

1. equestrian —A horseman. 

2. equestrienne —A horsewoman. 

3. equine —Horselike. 


7. no harm done 

The latin root noceo means to injure; someone who need cause 
you no fear, so harmless is that person, so unable to interfere, so 
unlikely to get you into trouble, is called— 

innocuous 


RELATED WORDS: 

1. innocent —Not guilty of crime or injury. 

2. noxious —Harmful, poisonous; unwholesome. 


8. alcoholic 

The Latin root bibo means to drink; and one who is generally 
found with one foot up on the brass rail, who likes to tipple be- 


482 



yond the point of sobriety—who, in short, has an overfondness 
for drinks with a pronounced alcoholic content, is called, usually 
humorously— 

bibulous 

RELATED WORDS: 

1. imbibe —To drink in, soak up, absorb. If we use this verb 
without specifying what is drunk, as in, “He likes to imbibe” the 
implication, of course, is always liquor; but imbibe may also be 
used in patterns like “imbibe learning” or “In early infancy she 
imbibed a respect for her parents.” 

2. bib —Upper part of an apron, or an apronlike napkin tied 
around a child’s neck. In either case, the bib prevents what is 
drunk (or eaten) from spilling over, or dribbling down, on the 
wearer’s clothing. 

9. like death itself 

The Latin root cado means to fall —one’s final fall is of course 
always in death, and so someone who looks like a corpse (figura¬ 
tively speaking), who is pale, gaunt, thin, haggard, eyes deep-sunk, 
limbs wasted, in other words the extreme opposite of the picture 
of glowing health, is called— 

cadaverous 

RELATED WORDS: 

1. cadaver —A corpse, literally, especially one used for surgical 
dissection. 

2. decadent —Etymologically, “falling down” (de- is a prefix 
one meaning of which is down, as in descend , climb down; decline , 
turn down; etc.). If something is in a decadent state, it is deterio¬ 
rating, becoming corrupt or demoralized. Decadence is a state 
of decay. Generally decadent and decadence are used figuratively 
—they refer not to actual physical decay (as of a dead body), but 
to moral or spiritual decay. 

10. pain and misery 

The Latin root doleo means to suffer or grieve —one who is 

483 



mviumui auu oau^ YYiiuat uiwiouuiuijr wumvis uum j^ujroivui ^/tuu jl 

mental distress, who seems to be suffering or grieving, is called— 

dolorous 


RELATED WORDS: 

1. dolor —A poetic synonym of grief . 

2. doleful —A word referring somewhat humorously to exag¬ 
gerated dismalness, sadness, or dreariness. 

3. condole —Etymologically, to suffer or grieve with (Latin 
con-, with, together). Condole is a somewhat less commonly used 
synonym of commiserate, a verb we discussed in Chapter 15. The 
noun condolence is much more frequently heard than the verb, as 
in, “Let me offer you my condolences,” usually said to someone 
mourning the death of a friend or relative. You have heard of 
condolence cards, and no doubt have sent your share of them. 
When you condole with somebody who has sustained a loss, usu¬ 
ally by death, you are saying, in effect, “I am suffering or grieving 
with you.”

TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST 

1. In logic, a conclusion not based on the evidence is called a 
non sequitur; by extension, the term is applied to any statement 
that appears to have no connection or relevance to what was said 
before. Knowing the root sequor, how would you define this term 
etymologically? _ 


2. Sequor , like many other Latin verbs, has another form some¬ 
what differently spelled. (Remember verto, versus and loquor, 
locutus?) The other form of sequor is secutus. Can you define the 
foHowing words in terms of the root? 

(a) second: _ 

(b) consecutive: _ 

(c) persecute: __ 

(d) prosecute: _ 


493 




3. Latin super , above or over, is used as a prefix in hundreds 
of English words. Can you figure out the word starting with super - 
that fits each etymological definition? 

(a) above others (in quality, position, etc.) _ 


(b) above the surface; not in depth ( adj.) 


(c) (flowing) above what is necessary; more than 

needed ( adj.)‘ ___ 

(d) above (or beyond) the natural (adj.) _ 


(e) to oversee; be in charge of (v.) 


4. Cado , to fall, is found in the following English words (some¬ 
times the root is spelled -rid) . Can you define each word in terms 
of its etymological parts? 

(a) cadence: _ 

(b) occidental: _:_ 

(c) deciduous: _ 

(d) incident: _1_ 

(e) accident: - 

(f) coincidence: -— 

5. The negative prefix in- plus doleo, to suffer, forms an ad¬ 

jective that etymologically means not suffering (pain), but actually 
means idle; lazy; disliking effort or work. Can you figure out the 
English word?_ 

Can you write the noun form?_ 

6. What does the feminine name Dolores mean etymologically?

mankind as the central fact, or ultimate aim, of the universe. The 
noun forms are either anthropocentrism (an'-thra-ps-SEN'-triz- 
om) or anthropocentricity (an'-th r^-po'-s^n-TRIS'-s-tee). 

2. Andromania (an'-dro-MAY'-nee-o), a combination of 
andros, man (male), plus mania , madness, signifies an obsession 
with males. Person: andromcmiac, one who is mad about men; ad¬ 
jective: andromaniacal (an'-dra-ma-NI'-s-ksl).

and mania, madness, is an obsession with one thing, or obses¬ 
siveness in one area. Person: monomaniac; adjective: monomani - 
acal (mon'-a-ma-NI'-a-kal).

CHAPTER 6: 

1. Sophomore; from sophos plus moros, foolish, the word ety¬ 
mologically designates one who is half wise and half foolish. The 
adjective sophomoric (sof-a-MAWR'-ik) describes people, atti¬ 
tudes, statements, writings, etc. that are highly opinionated, self- 
assured, and coming off as if wise, but which in reality are imma¬ 
ture, inexperienced, foolish, etc. 

2. Sophisticated (sa-FIS'-te-kay'-ted). The verb is sophisti¬ 
cate, the noun sophistication. One who is worldly-wise is a so¬ 
phisticate (sa-FIS'-ta-kst). 


507

highly developed, mature, or complicated; appealing to a mature 
intellect; or aware and knowledgeable . Examples: sophisticated 
machinery, electronic equipment; a sophisticated approach; a 
sophisticated audience, group, staff, faculty, etc. 

3. One who is obsessed with books, especially with collecting 
books. 

4. (a) speaking one language, (b) speaking two languages, (c) 
speaking three languages. 

Multilingual (multus, many, plus lingua) —speaking many lan¬ 
guages. 

A linguist is one who is fluent in many languages, or else an ex¬ 
pert in linguistics (or both). 

Multus, as indicated, means many, as in multitude, multiply, 
multiple, multicolored, multifarious, multilateral, etc., etc. 

5. (a) France, (b) Russia, (c) Spain, (d) Germany, (e) 
Japan, (f) China. 

6. (a) androphile, (b) gynephile (or philogynist ), (c) pedo¬ 
phile, (d) zoophile, (e) botanophile. 

But pedophilia (pee'-da-FIL'-ee-a) is another story. A pedo- 
philiac sexually molests young children—such love little kids can 
do without!

CHAPTER 7: 

1. A notable is someone well -known. 

2. To notify is, etymologically, to make known—notus + -fy, a 
derivation of facio, to make. 

Notice, as a noun, is what makes something known;, to notice, 
as a verb, is to observe (something or someone) so that it, he, or 
she becomes known to the observer. 

-Fy, as a verb suffix, means to make. So simplify is to make 
simple, clarify , to make clear; liquefy, to make liquid; putrefy, 
to make (or become) rotten or putrid; stupefy, to make stupid, or 
dumb, with astonishment (note the -e preceding the suffix in 
liquefy, putrefy, stupefy ); fortify, to make strong; rectify, to make 
right or correct; etc., etc. 

3. Chronograph (KRON'-s-graf') is an instrument that meas¬ 
ures and records short intervals of time. 

4. To generate is to give birth to, figuratively, or to create or 
produce, as a turbine generates power, a person’s presence gener¬ 
ates fear, etc. The noun is generation, which, in another context, 
also designates the people born and living about the same time 
(the older, previous, or next generation, the Depression genera- 


509 



tion, etc.), or a period, conventionally set at about thirty years, 
between such groups of people. 

To regenerate is to give birth to again, or to be born again. 
Some creatures can regenerate new limbs or parts if these are 
lost or cut off—or the limbs or parts regenerate . 

Re - means, of course, again; or, in some words, as recede, 
regress, etc., back. 

5. Omnipotent (om-NIP'-s-tant)—all-powerful; omnis plus 
potens, potentis, powerful. 

Omnipresent (om'-na-PREZ'-ant)—present all over, or every¬ 
where. 

Nouns: omnipotence, omnipresence. 

6. Anaphrodisiac (an-af'-ra-DIZ'-ee-ak')—both a noun and 
an adjective. Saltpeter is supposedly an anaphrodisiac; so, some 
people say, is a cold shower, which is highly doubtful. The best 
temporary anaphrodisiac is probably sexual intercourse. Some 
women who were teen-agers when Elvis Presley was at the height 
of his popularity have told me that the young man’s gyrating hips 
were aphrodisiacal —I will take their word for it, as Elvis has 
never turned me on. On the other hand, if you want to talk about 
Diane Keaton or Raquel Welch ... or especially Marilyn 
Monroe. . .

CHAPTER 9: 

1. Magnanimity (mag'-ns-NIM'-o-tee). Adjective: magnani¬ 
mous (mag-NAN'-s-mss). 

2. Bilateral (bl-LAT'-ar-ol), as in a bilateral decision, i.e., one 
made by the two sides or two people involved. On the other hand, 
a unilateral (yCb-na-LAT'-ar-sl) decision is made by one person, 
without consultation with others. 

3. Transcribe. Noun: transcription. A stenographer transcribes 
shorthand notes into English words, or a musical transcriber ar¬ 
ranges or adapts a musical composition for an instrument, group, 
etc. other than the one for which the work was originally written. 

4. Malaria was once thought to have been caused by the “bad 
air” of swamps; actually, it was (and is) transmitted to humans 
by infected anopheles mosquitoes breeding and living in swamps 
and other places where there is stagnant water. 

5. Confection. The word is hardly used much today with this 
meaning, except perhaps by members of an older generation who 
remember confectioner's shops and confectionery stores. Now 
such places are called ice cream stores (or ice cream parlors) and 
are run, at least on the west coast, by Baskin-Robbins or Farrell’s; 
or they are called candy shops; or, when I was growing up, candy 
stores , where the kids all hung out, and candies could be bought 
for a penny apiece, with Hershey bars selling for a nickel (that’s 
why they are called “the good old days”).

CHAPTER 10: 

1. Modus operandi. Method (or mode) of working (or operat¬ 
ing). Pronounced MO'-das op'-a-RAN'-dl, the word is not, of 
course, restricted to the special methods used by a criminal, but 
may refer to the method or style of operating characteristic of 
any other professional. Modus vivendi (MO'das va-VEN'-dl), 
etymologically “method of living,” is the style of life characteristic 
of a person or group. 

2. Circumscription. To circumscribe also means, figuratively, to 
write (a line) around (one’s freedom of action ), so that one is 
restricted, limited, hemmed in, as in, “a life circumscribed by 
poverty, by parental injunctions, or by an overactive conscience, 
etc.,” or “actions circumscribed by legal restraints.” The noun 
circumscription has the figurative meaning also. 

3. Somniloquent (sam-NIL'-a-kwant). Noun: somniloquence 
( sam-NIL'-o-kwans) or somniloquy (sam-NIL'-o-kwee), the latter 
noun also designating the words spoken by the sleeper. One who 
habitually talks while asleep is a somniloquist (sam-NIL'-a- 
kwist). 

4. An aurist is an ear specialist, more commonly called an 
otologist (o-TOL'-a-jist), from Greek oios, ear. Noun: otology . 
Adjective: otological (o-to-LOJ'-a-kal). 

It is difficult at this point to resist telling a well-known story 
about medical specialists. In fact it’s impossible to resist, so here it 
is: 

A dentist, doing his first extraction on a patient, was under- 

512 





standably nervous. When he got the molar out, his hand shook, he 
lost his grip on the instrument, and the tooth dropped down into 
the patient’s throat. 

“Sorry,” said the doctor. “You’re outside my specialty now. 
You should see a laryngologist! [lair'-ing-GOL'-o-jist—a larynx 
or throat specialist].” 

By the time the unfortunate victim got to the laryngologist, the 
tooth had worked its way much further down. 

The laryngologist examined the man. 

“Sorry,” said the doctor, “You’re outside my specialty now. 
You should see a gastrologist! [gas-TROL'-a-jist—a stomach spe¬ 
cialist].” 

The gastrologist X-rayed the patient. “Sorry,” said the doctor, 
“the tooth has traveled into your lower intestines. You should see 
an enterologist! [en'-to-ROL'-o-jist—an intestinal specialist].” 

The enterologist took some X rays. “Sorry, the tooth isn’t there. 
It must have gone down farther. You should see a proctologist! 
[prok-TOL'-a-jist—a specialist in diseases of the rectum; from 
Greek proktos, anus].” 

Our patient is now on the proctologist’s examining table, in the 
proper elbow-knee position. The doctor has inserted a procto¬ 
scope and is looking through it. 

“Good heavens, man! You’ve got a tooth up there! You should 
see a dentist!” 

5. Aural (AWR-al) refers to the ears or to the sense or phe¬ 
nomenon of hearing. Monaural reproduction, as of music over a 
radio or by a phonograph record, for example, has only one 
source of sound, and technically should be called monophonic 
(mon'-s-FON'-ik)— monos, one, plus phone, sound. Binaural 
may mean having two ears or involving the use of both ears; or, 
recently, descriptive of sound from two sources, giving a stereo - 
phonic (steer'-ee-a-FON'-ik) effect— stereos, deep, solid, plus 
phone. 

6. A noctambulist (nok-TAM'-bya-list) walks at night— nox, 
noctis, night, plus ambulo, to walk. Noun: noctambulism (nok- 
TAM'-by 9-liz-om ). 

7. Somnific (som-NIF'-ik): a somnific lecture, movie, effect, 
etc. 


513 



8. Circumambulate (sur'-ksm-AM'-bys-layt'). To circumnavi¬ 
gate is to sail around— circum, around, plus navis, ship.

CHAPTER 11: 

1. Matronymic (mat'-rs-NIM'-ik). Or, if you prefer to use the 
Greek root for mother {meter, metr -), metronymic. The Greek 
word metra, uterus, derives from meter, naturally enough, so 
metritis is inflammation of the uterus; metralgia is uterine pain; 
endometriosis (en'-do-mee'-tree-O'-sis) is any abnormal condi- 


514 




tion of the uterine lining— endo, inside; metra , uterus; -osis, ab¬ 
normal condition. 

2. (a) An incendiary statement, remark, speech, etc. figura¬ 

tively enflames an audience, sets them afire, gets them 
excited, galvanizes them into action, etc. 

(b) Incense (IN'-sens) is a substance that sends off a 
pleasant odor when burned—often, but not neces¬ 
sarily, to mask unpleasant or telltale smells, as of ma¬ 
rijuana smoke, etc. 

(c) To incense (in-SENS') is to anger greatly, i.e., to 
“burn up.” “I’m all burned up” is etymologically an 
accurate translation of “I’m incensed” 

3. (a) Ardent (AHR'-dant)—burning with zeal, ambition, 

love, etc., as an ardent suitor, worker, etc. 

(b) Ardor (AHR'-dor)—the noun form of ardent —burn¬ 
ing passion, zeal, enthusiasm, etc. Alternate noun: 
ardency (AHR'-don-see). 

4. Megaphone. 

5. Megalopolis (meg'-o-LOP'-o-lis). 

6. Police . Politics . 

7. Bibliokleptomaniac (bibMee-o-klep'-to-MAY'-nee-ak): one 
who has an obsession for stealing books. Not too many years ago, 
an author titled his book. Steal This Book!, perhaps hoping to 
appeal to bibliokleptomaniacs; if the appeal was successful enough, 
his royalty statements must have been minuscule indeed! 

Gynekleptomaniac. 

Pedokleptomaniac . 

A ndrokleptomaniac . 

Demokleptomaniac. 

If you prefer to use shorter words, compulsive kidnapper or 
obsessive abductor will do as well for these words. 

8. Acromaniac. 

Agoramaniac . 

Claustromaniac . 

9. Kleptophobe; pyrophobe; gynephobe; androphobe; demo - 
phobe. 

Triskaidekaphobia (tris'-kl-dek'-s-FO'-bee-s) is the morbid 

515 



areaa or tne numoer io, irom ureex tris/cai , rnree, aeKa, ten, ana 
phobia. 

10. Gnosiology (no'-see-OL'-a-jee), the science or study of 
knowledge. 

11. Amadeus is love (Latin amof) God (Latin deus). Theo - 
philus is love (Greek philos ) God (Greek theos). Gottlieb is 
love (German Lieb) God (German Gott). 

Perhaps this explains why he started composing at the age of 
four and wrote forty-one symphonies. 

12. Cellophane— cellulose made to be transparent, i.e., to show 
what’s wrapped in it. 

13. Hypoglycemia (hi-po-gll-SEE'-mee-a)—low blood sugar, 
a common ailment today, though I believe the AMA has called 
it a “non-disease” (Greek hypos, under; glykys , sweet; haima, 
blood). 

Haima, blood, is found in many English words, the root spelled 
either hem- or -em. Here are a few, with their etymological inter¬ 
pretations: 

(a) Hemorrhage —excessive blood flow. 

(b) Anemia —“no blood”—actually a pathological reduc¬ 
tion of red blood corpuscles. 

(c) Hematology —science of blood (and its diseases). 

(d) Hemophilia —“love of blood”—actually a hereditary 
condition, occurring in males, in which the blood clots 
too slowly. 

(e) Hemoglobin —“blood gobules”—actually the red col¬ 
oring matter of the red blood corpuscles. 

Hyperglycemia is the opposite of hypoglycemia. 

14. (a) Pantheon (PAN'-thee-on')—a temple built in Rome 

in 27 b.c. for “all the gods.” 

(b) Pandemonium (pan'-da-MO'-nee-am)—a word sup¬ 
posedly coined by poet John Milton in Paradise Lost 
to signify the dwelling place of all the demons; now 
any wild and noisy disorder. 

(c) Panorama (pan'-a-RAM'-a or pan'-a-RAH'-ma)—a 
view (or a picture of such a view) all around— pan, 
all, plus horama, view. The adjective: panoramic 
(pan'-a-RAM'-ik). 

15. Monarchy —.rule by one person.

CHAPTER 16: 


1. Non sequitur (non SEK'-wo-tsr)—“it does not follow.” 

2. (a) Second —following after the first. 

(b) Consecutive —following in proper order 

(c) Persecute —to follow (i.e., pursue) through and 
through; hence to annoy, harass continually for no good 
reason. 

(d) Prosecute —to follow before; hence to pursue (some¬ 
thing) diligently or vigorously in order to complete it 
successfully ( prosecute a campaign); or to start, or en¬ 
gage in, legal proceedings against, especially in an of¬ 
ficial capacity. 

3. (a) Superior. 

(b) Superficial. 

(c) Superfluous (sa-PUR'-floO-ss). Noun: superfluity (soo'- 
por-FLOO'-o-tee).

4. (a) Cadence (KAY'-dons)—fall and rise of the voice in 

speaking; hence inflection, rhythm beat, etc. of sound or 
music. Adjective: cadent (KAY'-dont).

Hence relating to western countries, since the sun falls 
in the west; also, a native of such a country. Noun: Oc¬ 
cident (OK'-sa-dsnt). The sun rises in the east, so 
Latin orior, to rise, is the origin of the Orient, oriental, 
etc., and also of the verb orient (AW'-ree-ent'). To or¬ 
ient is to adjust to a place or situation; etymologically, 
to turn, or face, east. Noun: orientation. Tm finally 
oriented” does not mean that I’m eastemized or facing 
east, but that I have become familiar with, and comfort¬ 
able in, a place, job, situation, etc. So to disorient (dis- 
AW'-ree-entO is to remove (someone’s) orientation, or 
to confuse or bewilder, especially in reference to locality, 
direction, etc. Noun: disorientation. 


522 



(c) Deciduous (ds-SIJ'-Oo-ss)—falling down (Latin prefix

to, toward) someone or something (by chance). 

(f) Coincidence—co- is a respelling of con-, together. A 
coincidence occurs when two things befall, or happen, 
together, or at the same time, and by chance. 

5. Indolent (IN'-do-fent). Noun: indolence (IN'-da-bns). 

6. Dolores —from Spanish Maria de los Dolores, Mary of the 
Sorrows; hence, I guess, someone who is generally sorrowful, 
though the few Doloreses I have known do not live up to their 
etymology.

HOW TO KEEP BUILDING 
YOUR VOCABULARY 


At commencement exercises, whether in elementary school, high 
school, or college, at least one of the speakers will inevitably point 
out to the graduates that this is not the end—not by a long shot. 
It is only the beginning; that’s why it is called “commencement,” 
etc., etc. 

Of course the speaker is right—no educative process is ever the 
end; it is always the beginning of more education, more learning, 
more living. 

And that is the case here. What has happened to you as a result 
of your reaction to the material and suggestions in this book is 
only the beginning of your development. To stop increasing your 
vocabulary is to stop your intellectual growth. You will wish, I am 
sure, to continue growing intellectually as long as you remain 
alive. And with the momentum that your weeks of hard work 
have provided, continuing will not be at all difficult. 

Let me offer, as a summary of all I have said throughout the 
book, a recapitulation of the steps you must take so that your vo¬ 
cabulary will keep growing and growing. 

STEP ONE. You must become actively receptive to new words. 

Words won’t come chasing after you—you must train yourself 
to be on a constant lookout, in your reading and listening, for any 
words that other people know and you don’t 


524 



STEP TWO. You must read more . 

As an adult, you will find most of the sources of your supply of 
new words in books and magazines. Is your reading today largely 
restricted to a quick perusal of the daily newspaper? Then you 
will have to change your habits. If your aim is to have a superior 
vocabulary, you will have to make the time to read at least one 
book and several magazines every week . Not just this week and 
next week—but every week for the rest of your life. I have never 
met a single person who possessed a rich vocabulary who was not 
also an omnivorous reader. 

STEP THREE. You must learn to add to your own vocabulary 
the new words you meet in your reading. 

When you see an unfamiliar word in a book or magazine, do 
not skip over it impatiently. Instead, pause for a moment and say 
it over to yourself—get used to its sound and appearance. Then 
puzzle out its possible meaning in the context of the sentence. 
Whether you come to the right conclusion or not, whether indeed 
you are able to come to any intelligent conclusion at all, is of no 
importance. What is important is that you are, by this process, 
becoming superconscious of the word. As a result, you will sud¬ 
denly notice that this very word pops up unexpectedly again and 
again in all your reading—for you now have a mind-set for it. 
And of course after you’ve seen it a few times, you will know 
fairly accurately not only what it means but the many ways in 
which it can be used. 

STEP FOUR. You must open your mind to new ideas. 

Every word you know is the translation of an idea. 

Think for a few minutes of the areas of human knowledge that 
may possibly be unknown to you—psychology, semantics, science, 
art, music, or whatever. Then attack one of these areas methodi¬ 
cally—by reading books in the field. In every field, from the sim¬ 
plest to the most abstruse, there are several books written for the 
average, untrained lay reader that will give you both a good grasp 
of the subject and at the same time add immeasurably to your vo¬ 
cabulary. College students have large vocabularies because they 


525 



are required to expose themselves constantly to new areas of 
learning. You must do the same. 

STEP FIVE. You must set a goal. 

If you do nothing about your vocabulary, you will learn, at 
most, twenty-five to fifty new words in the next twelve months. By 
conscious effort you can learn several thousand. Set yourself a 
goal of finding several new words every day. This may sound am¬ 
bitious—but you will discover as soon as you start actively look¬ 
ing for new words in your reading, and actively doing reading of a 
more challenging type, that new words are all around you—that 
is, if you’re ready for them. And understand this: vocabulary 
building snowballs. The results of each new day’s search will be 
greater and greater—once you provide the necessary initial push, 
once you gain momentum, once you become addicted to looking 
for, finding, and taking possession of new words. 

And this is one addiction well worth cultivating!

AWOL. Pass the buck.

One of the special traits of American 
English is its ablility to absorb new 
words and metamorphize new meanings 
for existing words. A primary impetus 
for this has always been war. In his 
new book, WAR SLANG, noted word 
historian and author Paul Dickson offers 
the first comprehensive collection of 
fighting words and phrases used by 
Americans at war.
